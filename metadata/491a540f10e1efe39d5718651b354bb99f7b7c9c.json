Even from the very first moments you can tell this is a shameless COBRA rip-off with Kristoff stealing the famous &quot;You have the right to remain silent&quot; line and then blowing up a gas station to kill a bunch of drug-crazed, robbing, raping, murderous scumbags! Besides desperately trying to be the new Marion Cobretti, he is also a ninja, using brutal methods to fight crime. An absolute essential for every self-respected trash cinema fan, DOUBLE EDGE is an obscure classic from the golden era of Filipino action! Do not miss our gorgeous-looking, fully uncut Japanese import which includes all the over the top violence!  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:491a540f10e1efe39d5718651b354bb99f7b7c9c","amp;dn":"Double+Edge+%281986%29+Romano+Kristoff","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"491a540f10e1efe39d5718651b354bb99f7b7c9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,26,84,15,16,225,239,227,157,87,24,101,27,53,75,185,159,123,124,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
