It was basically just a group creating light-hearted songs for the enjoyment of it. It's a real shame they had to go and have a tiff and then split up. They're quite catchy songs too, I've listened to a couple many times and learned the lyrics pretty fast. If you're not one for comical music, don't bother listening to it.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n110 % Free of virus and the best quality i could find on the internet!
