The series revolves around a group of military protagonists with &quot;nanosuits,&quot; technologically advanced suits of armor that allow them to gain enhanced physical strength, speed, defense, and cloaking abilities. The protagonists face off against both hostile North Korean soldiers as well as ice-based aliens who have come to Earth for unclear reasons.\n\n\nCrysis (2007)\n\nAfter Helena Rosenthal sends a distress signal saying the North Koreans are invading the seemingly unimportant island on which her team is working, the US government dispatches Raptor Team, a group of nanosuit-clad soldiers. After arriving on the island, however, Raptor Team's ranks are thinned by mysterious flying creatures, eventually leaving only Nomad, Psycho, and Prophet, who is subsequently kidnapped by the organisms. Nomad rescues Helena but is eventually trapped in the alien ship after it unleashes an &quot;ice sphere&quot; on the island, freezing a great deal of the island. Nomad escapes the island with Helena and an oddly-behaving Prophet, and returns to the US carrier fleet, where he finds Psycho. Prophet returns to the island, which is subsequently nuked in the attempt to kill the aliens. However, they only grow stronger from the energy. The aliens launch a massive attack on the carrier fleet, successfully destroying it. Nomad, Psycho, and Helena escape and receive a distress signal from the still-alive Prophet, and decide to return to the island.\n\n\nCrysis Warhead (2008)\n\nDuring Psycho's own mission, he was sent to retrieve a captured alien from Colonel Lee and the Koreans. After numerous setbacks and the assistance of his friend O'Neill, Psycho successfully defeats Lee, obtains the alien, and brings it back to the carrier fleet. At this point, the story continues in the original title.\n\n\nCrysis Wars (2008)\n\nWarhead also contains Crysis Wars, a separate multiplayer game that improves upon the original game's multiplayer.\n\n\nCrysis: Maximum Edition (2009)\n \nDeveloper(s) Crytek \nPublisher(s) Electronic Arts \nEngine CryEngine 2 \nPlatform(s) Microsoft Windows \nRelease date(s) NA May 5, 2009[1]\nEU May 5, 2009[1]\n \nGenre(s) First-person shooter \nMode(s) Single-player, Multiplayer \nRating(s) ESRB: Mature\nPEGI: 16+\n  \nCrysis: Maximum Edition is a compilation of all titles in the Crysis series released at the time: Crysis (2007) and Crysis Warhead and Crysis Wars (2008) published by Electronic Arts.
