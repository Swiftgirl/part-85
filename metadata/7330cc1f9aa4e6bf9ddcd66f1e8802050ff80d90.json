Their guide Jim uses a small motor boat and takes the tourist along the river to a remote spot. When they stop, they are attacked by a huge crocodile that capsizes their boat and immediately kills Jim. The three survivors climb a tree and when they realize that help would never come to rescue them, they decide to try to find a way out of their sheltered location. However, in the muddy water, their boat is flipped and the crocodile stalks the trio under the water.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7330cc1f9aa4e6bf9ddcd66f1e8802050ff80d90","amp;dn":"Black+Water","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7330cc1f9aa4e6bf9ddcd66f1e8802050ff80d90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,48,204,31,154,164,230,191,157,220,214,111,30,136,2,5,15,248,13,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
