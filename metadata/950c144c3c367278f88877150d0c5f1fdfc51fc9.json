Night guard Larry Daley (Ben Stiller), now a successful entrepreneur, returns to the Museum of Natural History to visit his friends - the exhibits that come to life at night - only to learn that they are being shipped off into deep storage at the Smithsonian Institution. To make matters worse, the exhibits at the Smithsonian, including the pharaoh Kahmunrah (Hank Azaria), are suddenly coming to life - and they aren't at all happy about their new visitors.\n\nDetermined to save his friends, Larry rushes to Washington, D.C., and makes his way into the inner workings of the largest museum complex in the world while Kahmunrah recruits the likes of Ivan the Terrible (Christopher Guest), Napoleon (Alain Chabat), and Al Capone (Jon Bernthal). Larry, meanwhile, finds himself with spunky Amelia Earhart (Amy Adams) as a co-conspirator and love interest, and General Custer (Bill Hader) leading the battle for the Smithsonian.\n\nThe stakes are higher in this sequel, where even the paintings on the Smithsonian walls come to life at night. Stiller is his capable deadpan self as the now-successful Larry who finds purpose again while helping his friends, and Adams is spot-on as feisty, adventure-seeking Earhart, complete with period lingo. Azaria is a scene-stealer as Kahmunrah, who is menacing despite his lisp. Owen Wilson, Steve Coogan, Robin Williams, and Ricky Gervais also reprise their roles in this sequel, which is the first film to be shot at the Smithsonian.\n\n\nFormat : MPEG-4\nFormat profile : Base Media / Version 2\nCodec ID : mp42\nFile size : 1.52 GiB\nDuration : 1h 40mn\nOverall bit rate : 2 164 Kbps\nEncoded date : UTC 2010-02-23 21:20:56\nTagged date : UTC 2010-02-24 02:08:35\nWriting application : HandBrake 0.9.3 2008112300\n\nVideo\nID : 1\nFormat : AVC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;307d51595e707c041e00&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 3 frames\nCodec ID : avc1\nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration : 1h 40mn\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 2 000 Kbps\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 436 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 2.35:1\nFrame rate mode : Variable\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nMinimum frame rate : 12.500 fps\nMaximum frame rate : 25.000 fps\nResolution : 8 bits\nColorimetry : 4:2:0\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.255\nStream size : 1.40 GiB (92%)\nWriting library : x264 core 65\n\nLanguage : English\nEncoded date : UTC 2010-02-23 21:20:56\nTagged date : UTC 2010-02-24 02:08:35\nColor primaries : BT.601-6 525, BT.1358 525, BT.1700 NTSC, SMPTE 170M\nTransfer characteristics : BT.709-5, BT.1361\nMatrix coefficients : BT.601-6 525, BT.1358 525, BT.1700 NTSC, SMPTE 170M\n\nAudio\nID : 2\nFormat : AAC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat version : Version 4\nFormat profile : LC\nFormat settings, SBR : No\nCodec ID : 40\nDuration : 1h 40mn\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 160 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate : 214 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : L R\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nStream size : 115 MiB (7%)\nLanguage : English\nEncoded date : UTC 2010-02-23 21:20:56\nTagged date : UTC 2010-02-24 02:08:32\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:950c144c3c367278f88877150d0c5f1fdfc51fc9","amp;dn":"NIGHT+%40THE+MUSEUM+2-BATTLE+OF+THE+SMITHSONIANS+IN+H.264+BY+KIDZC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"950c144c3c367278f88877150d0c5f1fdfc51fc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,12,20,76,60,54,114,120,248,136,119,21,13,12,95,31,223,197,31,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
