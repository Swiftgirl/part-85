The victims were about to file a certificate of candidacy for Esmael Mangudadatu, vice mayor of Buluan town. Mangudadatu was challenging Datu Unsay mayor Andal Ampatuan, Jr., son of the incumbent Maguindanao governor Andal Ampatuan, Sr., in the forthcoming Maguindanao gubernatorial election, part of the national elections in 2010. The 57 people killed included Mangudadatu's wife, his two sisters, journalists, lawyers, aides, and motorists who were witnesses or were mistakenly identified as part of the convoy.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has called the Maguindanao massacre the single deadliest event for journalists in history. At least 34 journalists are known to have died in the massacre. In a statement, CPJ executive director Joel Simon noted that the killings, &quot;appears to be single deadliest event for the press since 1992, when CPJ began keeping detailed records on journalist deaths.&quot; The CPJ further noted that, &quot;Even as we tally the dead in this horrific massacre, our initial research indicates that this is the deadliest single attack on the press ever documented by CPJ.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maguindanao_massacre&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maguindanao_massacre&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nFrom The Philippine Daily Inquirer, Dec. 28, 2009:\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nBootleg DVDs of Maguindanao massacre on sale.\n\nDAVAO CITY - Bootleg digital video disc (DVD) copies of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMaguindanao Massacre 11/23/09,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are now being sold underground in many parts of Mindanao, according to those who have seen the film.
