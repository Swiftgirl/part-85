This modern approach brings with it new weapons, action and\noptions. Coupled with a variety of gameplay modes including single player,\nmultiplayer and the co-op Special Ops Mode, it is destined to be one of the\nmost popular games of 2009 and a worthy addition to the Call of Duty series\n\n:info:\nMinimum Requirements:\nOS: Microsoft Windows XP or Windows Vista\nProcessor: Intel Pentium 4 3.2 GHz or AMD Athlon 64 3200 + processor\nor better supported\nMemory: 1 GB RAM\nGraphics: 256 MB NVIDIA GeForce 6600GT or better or\nATI Radeon 1600XT or better\nDirectX Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®: Microsoft DirectX (R) 9.0c\nHard Drive: 12GB of free hard drive space\nSound: 100% DirectX 9.0c compatible sound card\n- Auto-run DVD Menu.\n- Skin Installation.\n-16 image changing when Installation Is In Progress.\n-Multiplayer and Single Player Shortcuts To Desktop.\n-Split to 3 DVD, now you can burn it to DVD and keep for collection\n\n:notes:\n1) Mount or Burn images.\n2) Install the game.\n3) Run Single Player Shortcut From Your Desktop.\n4) Play Game.\n*For Multiplayer :\n1) Install Steam.\n2) Extract RAR From Disk3 (Multiplayer Crack) Folder.\n3) Copy Files To Your Install Folder.\n4) Run Steam.\n5) Create Account Or Login.\n6) Run Multiplayer Shortcut From Your Desktop.\n7) Play Game.\nThis is game of the year for sure.
