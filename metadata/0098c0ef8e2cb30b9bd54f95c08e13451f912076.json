At school, Adam is \n       able to control his outbursts, but home is a constant battleground.\n       \n       Adam's anger has been affecting the whole family but family life \n       has not always been that way, explains Sharon: 'He was what I call \n       a perfect son. I never had problems with him at all. It was when \n       Adam turned five or six that his behaviour started to change.'\n       \n       With Adam's behaviour growing increasingly worse, the family GP \n       has referred them to specialist NHS unit CAMHS in Greenwich - part \n       of the national network of child and adolescent mental health \n       services. Working with the family and closely observing how they \n       interact, the family therapists come up with a programme to \n       connect the family again. But can they reunite mother and son?\n       \n       Over the past three years, Ryan (16) has been caught stealing from \n       home, been excluded from school and smashed up the house, but the \n       worst of his behaviour is targeted at his mum Cathy.\n       \n       Ryan lives with his mum, his older sister Annie and his mum's \n       fiance Jamie. He's been going missing from home recently, and was \n       once found sleeping on a night bus.\n       \n       Ryan and his family have been attending CAMHS for nine months and, \n       although there has been some improvement in Ryan's behaviour, his \n       family still don't trust him alone. Can CAMHS counsellors help Ryan \n       get to the nub of his problems before it's too late?\n\n\n                             Big up all scene massive!\n\n\n    \n                                       \n                GROUP  INFORMATION          \n         9 Years of the Force and still    \n                      going strong                  \n     \n\n           What we are looking for:\n\n           * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n           * Fios x264 rippers or cappers\n           * also we have a contest to annouce we are in need of a\n           * new nfo ascii artwork design email us with your designs\n           * winners artwork will be added as our new nfo\n           * dont forget to tag your work\n           * If you think you can help contact us on irc\n           * or email us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;edab829f8e88ad85989e85c38c84&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0098c0ef8e2cb30b9bd54f95c08e13451f912076","amp;dn":"I.Hate.Mum.2010.WS.PDTV.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0098c0ef8e2cb30b9bd54f95c08e13451f912076","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,152,192,239,142,44,179,11,155,213,79,149,192,142,19,69,31,145,32,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
