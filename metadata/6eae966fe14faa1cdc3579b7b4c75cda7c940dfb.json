The companyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s word was enough. Police departments embraced the new and promising technology.\n\nA decade later, more than 400 people have died in North America ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“proximal to Taser use.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢  That is raising doubts about those early claims. Human Rights groups clamor for more independent research into the weapon and national standards for its use. Newspaper editorials demand the kind of testing that they say was not done those ten years ago. Today the Taser is described as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“less-lethalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and capable of causing of injury.\n\nTasered takes a comprehensive look at the Taser after ten years. The documentary examines the Taser from within a major Canadian metropolitan police department ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the Calgary Police Service (CPS). They have been using Tasers for more than 4 years. And theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been keeping what are arguably among the most comprehensive ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“use of forceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ statistics in North America since they adopted its use.\n\nTasered is produced, directed and written by Lynn Raineault for CBCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s DOC ZONE.
