Still have the original cluebook by SEGA.\nPlayed Phantasy Star 3 and 4 om SegaMD.\nPlayed PS0 Xbox.\nPlayed PS Portable on PSP hooked with my two kids and theirs PSP.\nPlayed PSU Xbox360. Still have my guardian licence.\nPlayed PS-Zero on DSi.\nStarted PSO server for PC.\n\nAnd now...\n\nClosed PSO server in exchange for PSOBB server... For the 2nd time. I got a little\nmore experienced.\n\n\n-------------------------------FEATURES-------------------------------------------\n\nWhy PSOBB (Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst) when there're alot better versions or\neven better mmorpgs? Well...\n\n1. It's free of charge! SEGA abandoned this project long time ago.\n2. It's small and not too old game so it will work on everybodys PC or even\n   notebooks and various OS. You can even turn on max anti-alias of your gfx card\n   for it to be gorgeous and still have alot of fps.\n3. Superb grafix that matches many of the newer games of today.\n4. Cross platform with GC and DC. Not sure if it works on my server thou.\n5. Simple and easy UI and HUD. Easy to learn gameplay. Even a 5y old kid can\n   understand it. I shit you not. My 5y old daughter is playing with me.\n6. Addictive gameplay because of the various quests and stuff that can be played\n   both multiplayer and solo. Different quests solo and multi player.\n7. It's a Japan kind of action relationship game. The more and different player\n   that plays, the better the loot.\n8. Lots of different enviroment to explore.\n9. I got lucky enough to get the server workin despite my poor programing skills.\n10.Accounts will never be deleted because of idleness.\n11.Also... My server is set to give 10x exp gain from kills! You will be able to\n   reach ultimate in no time.\n\n\n-------------------------------FILE INFO------------------------------------------\n\nPSOBB-Frez_v2.rar\t\t-&gt; Client for PSOBB revised with better gfx.\nReadme_Frezzno.txt\t\t-&gt; This text documant.\nPSOBB-Frez_server_exex.rar\t-&gt; You only have to download this if you already\n\t\t\t\t   have PSOBB client installed.\n\nServer files are from http://www.pioneer2.net . Easy to setup, even a crazy guys\nlike me managed right, so cudos to them.\n\nClient that you will download are mainly from pioneer2. It has been modyfied with\nextra graphics from various sources. I don't know exactly from where. I'm only\nrappy I got it workin. Cudos to www.schtserv.com anyways.\n\nVirus and trojan free guaranteed. Don't believe me? Go in to the forums of the\nsite I just gave cudos to. Seems like some SEGA crew have reported them as virus\nand trojans. It will wear off eventually.\n\n\n------------------------------INSTALLATION----------------------------------------\n\n1. Send a mail to &quot;&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;87f7f4e8e5e5a9e1f5e2fdfde9e8c7e4e8eaefe2eaa9f4e2&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;&quot; with your desired account name and\n   password. With no symbols, only a-z and 0-9. Optional email you like your\n   account to be registered to, otherwise I'll use the mail you sent it from.\n   Allow like 5-10 min after I got your mail for your account to be activated.\n   Do this as soon as you can so you will be able to play.\n\n   Sorry to say that I work m-f 7.00-16.00 GMT+1. Registraition within that time\n   will be activated afterwards.\n\n2. Unpack &quot;PSOBB-Frez.rar&quot; to your desired place in your PC.\n\n3. Run &quot;install.reg&quot; once.\n\n4. Run &quot;online.exe&quot; and set your options. Vista and Win 7, run &quot;vonlin.exe&quot;.\n\n5. When done press &quot;Start game&quot;.\n\n6. Welcome to my ship.\n\n\nOPTIONAL OPTIONS\n\nAfter you have run options with all the patches downloaded and your options are set you can run &quot;psobb.exe&quot; to enter the game without the\nloader. Vista and Win7 run &quot;vista.exe&quot;.\n\nVISTA and WIN7\n\nMight have typing issues. If so... Go to national, region and language settings\nin controlpanel of your OS. In the language tab unselect all &quot;Supplemantal\nlangage support&quot;.\n\nIf it still doesn't work!\n\nTry install jap keyboard language. Assign shortcut keys so that you can switch\nlanguages in game. Then it should work.\n\nIf it still doesn't work!\n\nvisit www.schtserv.com or www.pioneer2.net and look for answers in their forums.\n\n\n-------------------------------FINAL STUFF----------------------------------------\n\nSome of the ingame graphics and UI have been changed for some better ones,\nacording to me anyways. But feel free to change some if you like. All stuff have\nbeen taken from www.schtserv.com forum.\n\nI don't know how to program and stuff so this server is running in pretty much\ndefault settings. Only exp boost was applied. I can imagine that many of the\nquests are buggy and many of them cant be executed at all. So...\nPlease give some server tips and trix so that my server will run better. Also\ndon't hesite to email about other PSO related stuff. Why not comment something.\n\nemail: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;275754484545094155425d5d49486744484a4f424a095442&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nAlso I would like to keep my server clean and deasent. Try not to cheat or stuff\nlike that. The gameplay isn't that hard, my doughter managed. Plus you get an\nextra 10x exp gain per kill. You'll reach higher levels quicker and be able to\npick on harder and more fun difficulties sooner, without insane grinding as it\nwas ment to be played.\n\nRemember that cheating is only good if it goes unnoticed. Because other don't\ntolerate cheats I will probably have to ban the cheating account.\n\nGood luck!\n\n/best regard Frezzno\nhttp://www.remix64.com/member/frezzno\nhttp://www.last.fm/music/Frezzno/Frezzno\n\nAgain cudos to http://www.pioneer2.net and http://www.schtserv.com\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUPDATE\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2010-05-17 Teamspeak3 service added for all the members.\n\n2010-04-30 Palinurus summer\nAdded hi res graphics to forest. Added ep4 summer feels. New ep1 event quest, only temporary.\n\n2010-04-23 Palinurus Cherry Blossom Weekend!\nA celebration to Swedish Cherry Blossom at the Royal Gardens.\n\n2010-04-22 More multiplayer quests tuned with better meseta rewards.\nExcept for the event quests and EP4. Will continue to fix that later.\n\n2010-04-20 All episodes solo/side quests and TTF boosted meseta rewards!\nYou level ridiculously fast at this server and your wallet can't keep it up. So to fix that I've increased the meseta rewards for all solo/side quests. That should make them more desirable to do, since you can only do these quests once per difficulty. It's the least I can do for you, that's within my wanabe programmer skills. Also as a bonus, this applys to TTF too since many of you seems to like this quest. More changes to come later on.\n\n\n2010-04-19\n\nHello again!\n\nThe last weeks competition went quite well. We got a new and better shipname. I got the chance to deliver the reward to the winner, took 2 days but it got delivered. Also another screw up from my part; totally forgot to deliver extra mesetas to some of those who participated. Please give me a chance here, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not that I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have mesetas (cough) itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s because we are online at different times. So a small message to those who I still owe some mesetas; you will get them.\n\nNow to something differentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve just noticed that the welcome message at the login screen is quite limited. I constantly update or have something important (cough) to announce so the older stuff will quickly disappear at the bottom. (Yes IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve tried page and arrow down, hello?) So I need new ways to reach you good people of PSO. So from now on the welcome message will be short and brief.\n\nAnd while I think of new ways, here are some important updates so far:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tNew bank feature. Type /bank to switch between them.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tAltered the exe files to show English stuff. Please run online.exe alternately vonlin.exe at least once for it to update to new exe. (Otherwise youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll loop at the update page.) After that youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re free to run psobb.exe or vista.exe directly.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tAdded some new quests.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tSome of the quests have been translated or at least partly translated.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tMessed up with some textures, please take a look at ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ_Original_u_dragon.txtÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in your game folder.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tAdded a small turn off music bat file, please take a look at ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ_Perfect_silence.txtÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in your game folder.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tAdded more stuff to the game folder like keyboard layout picture.\n\nWellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s all for now phew. Much shorter than the last one huh.\n\nC U online.\n\n/Frezzno \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(Update from around Easter.)\n\nHello!\n\nJust wanna give you some new infos about my PSOBB server and some tips and trix.\n\nFirst letÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s give a lot of cudos to Sodaboy (PSOBB server programmer) at pioneer2.net for the latest server update. In this update you now have a common bank which can be reached by all characters in your account.  Just type ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ/bankÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to switch between the banks before you speak to your bank manager. With the common bank youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll get 200 extra slots to put items in. Might not sound much but think of how easy it is now to trade items to your other characters, or using it properly you can trade items with other players with ease.\n\nOnce again, cudos to the mighty Sodaboy at pioneer2.net .\n\nNow some quick update info on my server so far:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tIncreased rare spawns because of low population. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re still too few to be able to buy stuff from other lucky players. Why not be lucky yourself.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\t10 times easier to find extra mags in those wild boxes. Sorry to say that the chances are still slim.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tPLUS 10x exp gain from killing stuff. This IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll keep for a long time. Hate to grind, but I see a downside to thisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ butÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tAdded  a new quest ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPhoton exchangeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a quest for low populated servers. You can trade in items for Photon Drops then PD for greater items. This quest can be found in EP2 shop quest. Read all about it here.\n\n2010-04-08\nDarn! Just noticed that I lost all the guild cards I've collected and team informations. Think this applys to all of you. Must be somting with the update. Hope it doesn't mather much.\nAlso added NEW file &quot;PSOBB-Difficulty_levels.txt&quot; to your game folder. Please check it out. If something's wrong then tell me.\n\n2010-03-31\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tNew bank feature, cudos to Sodaboy at pioneer2.net .\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tFiles added to data folder, 2 simple batch files. I screwed up with the graphics for ultimate dragon. Execute &quot;_1-Original_ult_dragon.bat&quot; in your data folder to restore the original graphics which contains nice icy environment with beautiful snowy mountains. But if you like the outer space volcanic one I included from the beginning then forget this. More details about this can be read in &quot;_Original_u_dragon.txt&quot; file in your main PSOBB folder.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tFile added to dataogg folder; &quot;_Perfect_silence.bat&quot;. It's a mute music batch file made by Erin of schserv/forum. You can read all about it in &quot;_Perfect_silence.txt&quot; in the main game folder, or at this link where it originally came from. Remember to have all sound on in options for this to take full effect.\n\n2010-03-27\nI couldn't pull off 100% weapons and armor drop which I promised and in this failed desperation I started the current 100% rare monster spawn. You just need to search for their spawn places.\n\n2010-03-22\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tRaised the chances of finding rare monsters by lots of times.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tAlso changed so that mesetas and tools stuff drops more frequent.\n\n2010-03-21\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tChanged in the exe files to show &quot;E&quot;lvl instead of &quot;J&quot;lvl after the names and &quot;Eng&quot; instead of &quot;Jpn&quot; in your guildcard.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tAdded keyboard layout picture and lobby actions and emotes key shortcuts list. Look in your game folder.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tAdded a tiny file to data folder that adds some nice table lamps in lobby 12.\n\n2010-03-20\nUpdated and more stable client with better gfx on many of the characters, forest sky, lobby 1-10 outside view, EP1 city high res textures plus more. New UI that's more like PSO with better icons. \n\n2010-03-19\nTotal server and client revision and testing.\n\n22010-03-15\nServer start up andÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Failed! Only me and all connected to my local network could play. But I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know that. Thought that PSOBB was dead because nobody else logged in.\n\n\nTips and trix\n\nRunning the game:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tYou probably already know this but you only need to run psobb.exe or vista.exe once the reg file have been executed, your options are set and after 2010-03-21 update. This will speed up things a little. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know why but fullscreen have failed since original PSO. The game shuts down when alt-tab out of it. Be sure to set your option to windowed, you can still resize.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tAdvanced effects in graphics advanced setup only looks good for ATI cards. Works poorly and only partly on other cards. So you might as well turn it off if you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have ATI.\n\nIn game:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tYou can browse the various nametag infos in the lobby by pressing the TAB key.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tCheck whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s in the group before joining by pressing TAB, press it again to see what quest theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re on. On the pad press left action palette button.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tExpress your feelings with your symbol chat. Press END then TAB or top action palette button then left palette button.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tMake a point in the Info Board (Options/Chat). Everyone in the party or same lobby can read it.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tWTH! Is there only quests in forest? Hehe, playing solo but canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t unlock more than forest quests? You need to do the Principals quests first. This can be done in multiplayers too, but you only unlock quests for each difficulty separately. (Took me a while to figure out, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m used to PSO.)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tNeed a quick exit from the game, or change character? Press ALT+BACKSPACE and youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll come to title screen, press ALT+BACKSPACE again for a quick exit to windows.\n\nOKÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Wanna be epic and have the best gear? Well you canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t do it alone. Me and Amy (42000017) had a little test and it turns out that drop charts goes after the party leader and not after the one with the killing blow. Be sure to check pso-world (Episode 1,2 &amp; 4) for your section ID drop chart thenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Choose the leader wisely, especially this weekend when youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re guaranteed a rare monster drop.\n\nYou also have various downloads there like magfeed timer, magfarm and section ID calculator. With magfarm you can simulate a feeding to see how your mag will turn out, so you know exactly how to feed it in the game.\n\n\nLinks\n\nClient for FrezznoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s server ThePirateBay or Extratorrent . Spread this mess and make it alive.\nPioneer2.net The one that started my mess now I canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t stop.\nSchthack The one that started the mess before all. OK I might not like them but still they have some good infos there.\nPSO-world Been on since I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know. They have great guides and downloads.\nPSOwiki.net Have great infos with simple and nice layout.\n\n\nWellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s all I got for now.\n\nThank you for downloading the client and registered an account at my server.\n\nI wish you a great and happy Easter.\n\n/Frezzno\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92d069f470b384914462433d8a85c510190f37b1","amp;dn":"Phantasy+Star+Online+Blue+Burst+-+Frez+server+v2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92d069f470b384914462433d8a85c510190f37b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,208,105,244,112,179,132,145,68,98,67,61,138,133,197,16,25,15,55,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
