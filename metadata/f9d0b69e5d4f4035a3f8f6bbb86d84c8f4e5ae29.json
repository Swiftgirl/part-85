This one directly involves the FED. Maybe now we can audit the books? \n\nPolice guns end up the hands of Pentagon, and Vegas shooters.... Its all just &quot;incompetence.&quot; Riiiiight. \n\nMORE Headlines from http://Deadlinelive.info\n\n\n\nHour 2: \n\nFilmmaker David Bond joins us to discuss his award winning film (showing at SXSW in Austin) ERASING DAVID. This &quot;docu-thriller&quot; takes on Big Brother like nothing else before it. In the film, Bond disappears, and dares to be found in an ever growing UK surveillance society... The results are surprising. There's no where to run. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.erasingdavid.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.erasingdavid.com&lt;/a&gt; to get a copy or arrange a screening in a town near you!\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance. I try to share information\n that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.\n NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as\n information.
