It also includes lunatics who meet annually for extremist rhetoric and hors dÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢oeuvres. Yes, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s CPAC time again!  If you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want the little quiches or the punch, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s plenty of hypocrisy to go around. Already this yearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s CPAC featured both Marco Rubio and Jim DeMint ridiculing President Obama for using telepromptersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ while reading off of teleprompters.   Did the scripts include an instruction saying ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtry not to look directly at the prompter while saying thisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½?\n\n\nYesterdayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s big news was that Dick Cheney made a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsurpriseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ visit to CPAC.  Surprise? Really? Ever since he left office, has Dick Cheney ever seen a microphone that he wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t drawn to like a moth to a light bulb? All you have to do is put a podium in front of a friendly audience, and Dick Cheney will show up. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œField of Dreams.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ If you build it, he will comeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and start lying. The CPAC crowd started yelling ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRun, Dick, run!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ First of all, that is NOT what you tell a guy who has had five heart attacks. Somebody in the crowd yelled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCheney in 2012!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ That shows there was at least one undercover Democrat in attendance. Believe me, nobody wants Dick Cheney to run for President more than Democrats. I would start a movement to draft Dick Cheney, but then heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pretty good at avoiding the draft.\n\n\nAnother surprise this year was the attendance of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œinvestigative journalistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ James OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Keefe.  It tells you all you need to know about the new generation of conservatives that their biggest idol had to get permission from his parole officer to leave his parentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ house and attend CPAC. For the progressive side, Rachel Maddow was at CPAC. I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t think she had to check with a parole officer first.\n\n\nIncidentally, this year CPAC is co-sponsored by the John Birch Society.  I know what youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re thinkingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ it really makes you kind of wonder what year this is.  You donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get any nuttier than the John Birch Society. But IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m sure that the new generation of conservatives is going to try.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc97bb64ee45dff7f3d9dc1fdcc58287f6c34d18","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+Feb+19+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc97bb64ee45dff7f3d9dc1fdcc58287f6c34d18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,151,187,100,238,69,223,247,243,217,220,31,220,197,130,135,246,195,77,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
