No more ugly batch files! The launchers generated by NativeJ look and behave exactly like native Win32 programs. Automatically generates Win32 native EXE for your Java applications. No more ugly batch files. They possess their own custom icons when viewed in Explorer, and they do not appear as another java.exe or javaw.exe in the process list.\nBesides looking and feeling like native apps, these launchers also have another advantage: speed. Executing a batch file requires first loading up the command processor, which steps through each line of the batch file before it encounters the line which calls the Java frontend java.exe or javaw.exe. This frontend imposes further overhead as it parses the command line arguments before loading the JVM with the proper parameters. The native launchers generated by NativeJ eliminates all these overhead and load the JVM directly, resulting in snappier program loading.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd8e48044abcd2a86293facdcfb3b1618e999179","amp;dn":"DobySoft.NativeJ.Professional.Edition.v4.8.9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd8e48044abcd2a86293facdcfb3b1618e999179","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,142,72,4,74,188,210,168,98,147,250,205,207,179,177,97,142,153,145,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
