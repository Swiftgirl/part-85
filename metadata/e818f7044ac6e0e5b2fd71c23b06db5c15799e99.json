A spin-off of the Sci Fi Channel series &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; set 50 years prior to the events of that show.\nTouted as &quot;television's first science fiction family saga,&quot; Caprica is from Battlestar Galactica executive producers, Ronald D. Moore and David Eick.[/quote]\n\n Visit this link:\n Visit this link:Visit this link: http://img69.Imageshack.us/img69/3/subeng.png\n\n Visit this link: http://img198.Imageshack.us/img198/1256/capricatrama.png\nIn the wake of the MAGLEV bombing that killed his daughter, Daniel Graystone plunges himself into work. He tries to figure out why he can only create a single intelligent robot, not understanding that the answer lies within the fact that part of his daughter survived the explosion and is closer to him than he could imagine. Consumed with grief, Amanda Graystone is obsessed with discovering who her daughter really was, and slowly begins piecing together the details of Zoe's life.\n\nZoe, trapped in the mechanical body, turns to her friend Lacy for help. At the same time, Headmistress Clarice Willow (Polly Walker) - a secret member of the shadowy &quot;Soldiers of the One&quot; terrorist group - is also focused on Lacy, putting the girl under pressure from all sides.\n\nIn the episode's culmination, at a memorial service for the victims of the train disaster, Joseph Adama confronts Daniel about the loss of his own daughter. Before they can come to an understanding, they are interrupted by a stunning public announcement from Amanda Graystone, who has become convinced that her daughter Zoe was to blame for the terrorist action.\n\n\n Visit this link: http://img27.Imageshack.us/img27/9764/capricascreenshots.png\n Visit this link: http://img85.Imageshack.us/img85/2248/caprica1x01pilotavi.th.png\nClick Per Ingrandire\n\n Visit this link: http://img686.Imageshack.us/img686/2415/capricatecnica.png\n\nNome File: Caprica - 1x02 - Rebirth.avi\nDimensione: 367,085,370 Bytes\nDurata: 45:51.518\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 901 kb/s\nRisoluzione: 624x352\nFPS (Frames/sec): 23.976\nQF (Frame quality): 0.171 b/px\n\nAudio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kb/s\nFreq Audio: 48000 Hz\n\n\nVisit http://www.tntvillage.scambioetico.org/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e818f7044ac6e0e5b2fd71c23b06db5c15799e99","amp;dn":"%5BHDTVrip+-+XviD+-+Eng+Mp3+-+Sub+Ita+Eng%5D+Caprica+S01e02+%5BTntvill","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e818f7044ac6e0e5b2fd71c23b06db5c15799e99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,24,247,4,74,198,224,229,178,253,113,194,59,6,219,92,21,121,158,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
