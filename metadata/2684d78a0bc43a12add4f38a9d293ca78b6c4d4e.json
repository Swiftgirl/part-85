Who are they? Bill Nelson (Fl.), Tom Carper (Del.), Blanche Lincoln (Ark.), Jim Webb (Va.), Mark Warner (Va.) and Ben Nelson (Neb.). The student lending industry has launched an ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œaggressive lobbying campaignÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of senators representing states where big lenders are based, scaremongering about job losses resulting from passing SAFRA. Now, it appears that their lobbying is paying off.
