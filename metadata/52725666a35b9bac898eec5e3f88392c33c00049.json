Now the town's British workers \n       have a chance to prove they can do it.\n       \n       Eleven British unemployed workers are recruited to go into a range \n       of different Wisbech workplaces including a potato company, an \n       asparagus farm, an Indian restaurant and a building site run by a \n       local landlord.\n       \n       Moving beyond the workplace, Evan Davis investigates how the town's \n       local public services, such as schools and the NHS, are coping with \n       the demands of the new arrivals.\n       \n       As the British unemployed workers get to grips with their new jobs, \n       this documentary examines the facts and dispels the myths around \n       the subject of immigration.\n\n\n                             Big up all scene massive!\n\n\n    \n                                       \n                GROUP  INFORMATION          \n         9 Years of the Force and still    \n                      going strong                  \n     \n\n           What we are looking for:\n\n           * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n           * Fios x264 rippers or cappers\n           * also we have a contest to annouce we are in need of a\n           * new nfo ascii artwork design email us with your designs\n           * winners artwork will be added as our new nfo\n           * dont forget to tag your work\n           * If you think you can help contact us on irc\n           * or email us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;12547d607177527a67617a3c737b&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52725666a35b9bac898eec5e3f88392c33c00049","amp;dn":"The.Day.The.Immigrants.Left.2010.DOCU.WS.PDTV.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52725666a35b9bac898eec5e3f88392c33c00049","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,114,86,102,163,91,155,172,137,142,236,94,63,136,57,44,51,192,0,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
