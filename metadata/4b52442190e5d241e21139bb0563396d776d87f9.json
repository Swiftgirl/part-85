The Montage have an approach that's a bit more rock-based overall, but there's definitely some Sergio-like touches in the music -- especially the way the two female vocalists sing together in a nicely spaced-out sort of sound -- warm, but with an undercurrent of coldness -- mixed in with some very groovy rhythms from Hagood Hardy on vibes, electric piano, marimba, and percussion! There's also a fair bit of bossa in the mix too -- not as overtly as on Brasil 66 records, and more filtered down into a 70s sort of hipness -- expanded out with wider pop influences, and some traces of Sunshine styles as well. Titles include great versions of &quot;Cast Your Fate To The Wind&quot;, &quot;Come Saturday Morning&quot;, &quot;Baby I'm A Want You&quot;, &quot;Guantanamera&quot;, &quot;It's Too Late/I Feel The Grass Grow Under My Feet&quot;, and &quot;If&quot; -- and the record would be right at home on A&amp;M! ~ Dusty Groove America\n\nPersonnel:\nHagood Hardy (e-p, p, vib, perc, arr)\nBill Bridges (g)\nRock Homme (b)\nDave Lewis (d)\nStephanie Taylor, Lynne McNeil (voc)\nRecorded at RCA Toronto\n\nHagood Hardy &amp; The Montage - Montage Tracks:\n01  Baby I'm A Want You\n02  The Garden Path\n03  How Insensitive\n04  Come Saturday Morning\n05  My Love\n06  How I Think Of You\n07  Cast Your Fate To The End\n08  If\n09  WonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t You Step Into My Life\n10  Medley: ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Too Late / I Feel The Grass Grow Under My Feet\n11  Guantanamera\n12  YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re Here\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b52442190e5d241e21139bb0563396d776d87f9","amp;dn":"Hagood+Hardy+%26+The+Montage+-+Montage+%281970%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bflac%5D%5Bschon55","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b52442190e5d241e21139bb0563396d776d87f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,82,68,33,144,229,210,65,226,17,57,187,5,99,57,109,119,109,135,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
