Tom and his wife decide to put them up for the weekend. However, their neighbor Paul, a disturbed ex-cop and a drunk, discovers that Crawldaddy's dysfunctional backwoods family has been killing people and skinning them alive to make their leather goods! Crawldaddy and her kids continue to find victims while fighting amongst each other (utilizing an impressive combination of vulgar yet hilarious insults), meanwhile Paul's personal life spirals out of control. It all builds to a final climactic confrontation.\n\nIMDB info : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098344/\n\nThis is the 1990 version. There is a 2008 movie with an 'aka' title of Skinned Alive, but this is not it.\n\nAnyway, Have a gander, do a bit of seeding and leave a comment.\n\nThanks ;)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:670b7a201ee8283c81f4a9f1444bae97713afbbd","amp;dn":"Skinned+Alive+%281990%29+-+John+Killough","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"670b7a201ee8283c81f4a9f1444bae97713afbbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,11,122,32,30,232,40,60,129,244,169,241,68,75,174,151,113,58,251,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
