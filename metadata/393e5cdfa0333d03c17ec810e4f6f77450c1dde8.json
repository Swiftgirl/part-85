In the story, Mater finds himself in an          \n       inescapable predicament. When McQueen questions Mater over whether the events in    \n       the story actually occurred, Mater responds, &quot;Don't you remember? You was there     \n       too!&quot;, and continues the story including McQueen's sudden participation. The        \n       cartoons end with Mater leaving the scene, often followed by characters or          \n       references to the story that was being told, putting up a possibility that the      \n       story might be real. Each story includes Mater, Lightning McQueen, Mia and Tia      \n       (the two red cars that adore Lightning McQueen), and various pit crew cars.         \n                                                                                           \n                                                                                           \n     \n\t \n                          WE'RE LOOKiNG FOR                     \n                             \n                                                                                          \n                     100Mbit+ Affil sites (w/ archives)                                   \n                     Broadcast/Network/PPV Cappers (US/UK/Aus) with PDTV/HDTV Sources     \n                     People with PDTV/HDTV sources with an interest in capping            \n                     TV/WWE/MMA DVD Rippers/Suppliers                                     \n                     Dump/Uplink/Shell Providers                                          \n                                                                                          \n                     Find us or email &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;0b7c3f6d68796e7c4b6c666a626725686466&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; if you can help                   \n                                                                                          \n     \n\n                               GREETZ                           \n                             \n                                                                                          \n                   All of you hobos keeping the UK and Sports scenes alive &lt;3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:393e5cdfa0333d03c17ec810e4f6f77450c1dde8","amp;dn":"Cars-Toons.WS.PDTV.XviD-W4F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"393e5cdfa0333d03c17ec810e4f6f77450c1dde8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,62,92,223,160,51,61,3,193,126,200,16,228,246,247,116,80,193,221,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
