Born and raised in The Hague, Holland, Kleinenberg's early influences were the American beats of Mantronix, remixer Shep Pettibone, and Jellybean Benitez coupled with the pop sounds of Depeche Mode. A humble beginning to his DJ career came at the age of 15 when he spun whatever the crowd wanted to hear at a bar around the corner from his home. It was enough to get him interested in producing his own music. 1996 saw the release of &quot;Y.D.W. (You Do Me Wrong),&quot; one of the few European tunes on the American house label Strictly Rhythm and released under his S'n'S moniker. Junior Vasquez, Deep Dish, and Danny Tenaglia were early supporters, and a relationship with the Combined record label yielded numerous 12&quot;s. A solid fan base was formed with fans seeking out all the editions of his 4 Seasons EP, but it was the success of 2000's My Lexicon 12&quot; that pushed him into the spotlight. His Tranceglobal Airways mix CD was included with the October 2000 issue of Muzik magazine, and his productions turned up a number of compilations in the ultrapopular Global Underground series. 2001 found him successfully remixing RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶yksopp's &quot;Poor Leno&quot; and winning the Best Radio 1 Essential Mix award from Muzik. 2002 saw his Essential Mix CD released, followed by his turn in the Global Underground: NuBreed series and another mix for Thrive, Renaissance Presents Everybody, a year later.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a53c16095db7ed1d714f2bf655988ccf9e7affd5","amp;dn":"This+Is+Vol.2+Right+Disc%282009%29-Sander+Kleinenberg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a53c16095db7ed1d714f2bf655988ccf9e7affd5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,60,22,9,93,183,237,29,113,79,43,246,85,152,140,207,158,122,255,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
