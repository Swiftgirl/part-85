He made and sold this CD years before he ever worked on the Howard Stern show and I bought it off of his website 10 years ago. Most of the CD is prank phone calls that he makes and some songs that he sings. This CD is so funny my favorite is the green towels call, I cannot believe how long he keeps this woman on the line with his nonsense. This is the second time I put this torrent up the first time the last three tracks were skipping but now it is fixed. I had to re rip the CD again. A must for all Stern fans \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b8ea5fee1a618908e96ecacea96897d4c151882","amp;dn":"Sal+The+Stockbroker++Straight+From+The+Horses+Mouth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b8ea5fee1a618908e96ecacea96897d4c151882","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,142,165,254,225,166,24,144,142,150,236,172,234,150,137,125,76,21,24,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
