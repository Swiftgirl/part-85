At least it was competitive right up until the end. Could President Obama penetrate the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRed ZoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in the chamber and get the Republicans up out of their seats to applaud? I loved it all, starting with the arrival of the celebrities. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the First Lady in a long-sleeved, plum-colored Isaac Mizrahi creation! This year she chose not to exercise her right to bare arms. Is John BoehnerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tawny hue getting deeper? I swear he was the exact color of the varnished wood in the House Chamber. What kind of skin care products do you use, JohnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Minwax? Whatever it is, it really brings out the woodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s natural beauty. If Boehner had a candle in his mouth he would have looked like a Halloween jack oÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ lantern thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been on the porch too long. And it was nice to see Joe Lieberman and Ben Nelson sitting beside each other. Given the way these guys block progress, I wonder if they were blocking anybodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s view?\n\nThe theme for the evening was ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwe wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t quit.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Well last night the Republicans wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t startÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ applauding. Come on, guys. Democrats gave George Bush at least polite applause, even when he was proposing all the idiot ideas that got us into this mess. Even when Obama went through a list of all the tax cuts heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s given to 95 percent of the American people there was no applause from the RepublicansÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½making it painfully obvious that they represent the other 5 percent. Of course, the highlight reel moment came from Justice Samuel Alito.   When the President said ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLast week the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests, including foreign corporations, to spend without limit in our elections,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Alito seemed to silently mouth the words ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNot true.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ It was kind of like seeing a mime version of Joe Wilson.\n\n\nFor you stat freaks, this is a much different SOTU fact check than those from the Bush years. For starters, there are actual facts to check. Fact checking a George Bush speech is like editing Sarah PalinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Twitter posts for grammar and spelling. Without getting into the details, hereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the best fact check available: James Inhofe says most of what Obama said ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t true.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ That right there is a strong indicator that everything he said was exactly true.  Bottom lineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½great game.
