During his owner's life HachikÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ saw him off from the front door and greeted him at the end of the day at the nearby Shibuya Station. The pair continued their daily routine until May 1925, when Professor Ueno did not return on the usual train one evening. The professor had suffered a stroke at the university that day. He died and never returned to the train station where his friend was waiting.\n\nHachikÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ was given away after his master's death, but he routinely escaped, showing up again and again at his old home. Eventually, HachikÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ apparently realized that Professor Ueno no longer lived at the house. So he went to look for his master at the train station where he had accompanied him so many times before. Each day, HachikÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ waited for Professor Ueno to return. And each day he did not see his friend among the commuters at the station.\n\nThe permanent fixture at the train station that was HachikÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ attracted the attention of other commuters. Many of the people who frequented the Shibuya train station had seen HachikÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ and Professor Ueno together each day. They brought HachikÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ treats and food to nourish him during his wait. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1028532/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1028532/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPLEASE SEED AND ENJOY THANKS\n\nTo view this file on youre PC then i recomend VLC Media player or Media Player Classic\n\nscreen shots\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img704.imageshack.us/img704/233/hachikoh264vicemp4thumb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img704.imageshack.us/img704/233/hachikoh264vicemp4thumb.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a87fd637d31eae4588a82440169c31add8b2f9f","amp;dn":"Hachiko+a+dogs+story%7BDvDRip.H264.%7Dvice","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a87fd637d31eae4588a82440169c31add8b2f9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,135,253,99,125,49,234,228,88,138,130,68,1,105,195,26,221,139,47,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
