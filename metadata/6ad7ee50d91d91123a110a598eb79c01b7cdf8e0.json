Meanwhile, \nAnderson does his best to be useful and new security measures are \nimplemented on the ship.\n\nEpisode 04:\n\nThe Fleet answers a distress call from an alien ship.

The crew has to resort to alternative methods \nof travel aboard the ship.\n\nEpisode 06:\n\nAnderson pines for Connie his first love. The crew loses the \nability to navigate the ship when they are controlled by a cloud. \nThe up side is that the cloud grants them wishes, the down side is \nthat the cloud grants them wishes.\n\nEpisode 07:\n\nThe Canadia receives word that their budget is being cut and the \nCaptain has to decide what to trim. Doc Gaffney isn't happy with \nhis decision and takes drastic action.\n\nEpisode 08:\n\nRomance is in the air on the Canadia. Lewis finds something big in \na pile of trash.

Faverau gets a promotion.\nAnderson and Lewis try to modify the robot.
