These are field songsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½songs to sing while working in the fields. They feature a basic call and response structure with ggwaenggwari and jangu accompaniment. The primary caller, Kang Bu Ja, is holder of Jeollanamdo Intangible Cultural Property 21 (Jangsando Deulnorae); the respondents are her senior students/assistants. The songs are similar to those in my previous upload of Jindo Field songs (Gang Bu-Ja was born and learned these songs in Jindo before moving to Jangsando and transmitting them to women there).\n\nTracks:\nÃƒÂ¬Ã…Â¾Ã‚Â¥ÃƒÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â°ÃƒÂ«Ã‚ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÂ«Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã‚Â¤ÃƒÂ«Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã‚Â¸\n1-2 ÃƒÂ«Ã‚ÂªÃ‚Â¨ÃƒÂ«Ã…â€œÃ‚Â¨ÃƒÂ«Ã…Â Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ÃƒÂ«Ã…Â¾Ã‹Å“ ÃƒÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã…â€™ÃƒÂ«Ã‚Â¦Ã‚Â¬ (Slow-Rice binding Song)\n3-4 ÃƒÂ«Ã‚ÂªÃ‚Â¨ÃƒÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â¹Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ«Ã…Â Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã…â€™ÃƒÂ«Ã‚Â¦Ã‚Â¬ (Rice Planting Song)\n5 ÃƒÂ«Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã‚Â¼ÃƒÂ«Ã‚Â§Ã‚Â¤ÃƒÂ«Ã…Â Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã…â€™ÃƒÂ«Ã‚Â¦Ã‚Â¬ (Weeding Song)\n6 ÃƒÂ«Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã‚Â¼ÃƒÂ«Ã‚Â§Ã‚Â¤ÃƒÂªÃ‚Â³Ã‚Â  ÃƒÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½Ã‚Â¼ÃƒÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Â´ÃƒÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã…â€œÃƒÂªÃ‚Â¸Ã‚Â° (Getting Up After Weeding)\n7 ÃƒÂ¬Ã‚Â§Ã‹â€ ÃƒÂªÃ‚Â¼Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ«Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â´ÃƒÂªÃ‚Â¸Ã‚Â° (Returning Song)\nÃƒÂ¬Ã…Â¾Ã‚Â¥ÃƒÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â° ÃƒÂ­Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‹Å“ÃƒÂ¬Ã‚Â¤Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ ÃƒÂ«Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â­ÃƒÂ«Ã‚Â§Ã‚Â¤ÃƒÂªÃ‚Â¸Ã‚Â° ÃƒÂ«Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã‚Â¸ÃƒÂ«Ã…Â¾Ã‹Å“\n8-9 ÃƒÂ«Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â­ÃƒÂ«Ã‚Â§Ã‚Â¤ÃƒÂ«Ã…Â Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã…â€™ÃƒÂ«Ã‚Â¦Ã‚Â¬ (Weeding Song)\n10 ÃƒÂ«Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â­ÃƒÂ«Ã‚Â§Ã‚Â¤ÃƒÂªÃ‚Â³Ã‚Â  ÃƒÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½Ã‚Â¼ÃƒÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Â´ÃƒÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã…â€œÃƒÂªÃ‚Â¸Ã‚Â° (Getting Up After Weeding)\n11 ÃƒÂ«Ã‚Â¯Ã‚Â¸ÃƒÂ¬Ã‹Å“Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ«Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã‚Â°ÃƒÂ«Ã…Â Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã…â€™ÃƒÂ«Ã‚Â¦Ã‚Â¬ (Cotton Picking Song)\n12-13 ÃƒÂ«Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃ‚Â¥ÃƒÂ«Ã¢â‚¬Â¹Ã‚Â¹ÃƒÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚Â  ÃƒÂ­Ã†â€™Ã¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ«Ã‚Â Ã‚Â¹ (Dungdangae Taryeong)\n\nMusicians:\nCaller: ÃƒÂªÃ‚Â°Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ÃƒÂ«Ã‚Â¶Ã¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¬Ã…Â¾Ã‚ï¿½ (Gang Bu Ja)\nRespondents:\nÃƒÂ«Ã‚Â°Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ÃƒÂªÃ‚Â¸Ã‹â€ ÃƒÂ«Ã¢â‚¬Â¹Ã‚Â¨ (Bak Geum Dan)\nÃƒÂ¬Ã‚Â§Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÂªÃ‚Â¸Ã‹â€ ÃƒÂ¬Ã‹â€ Ã…â€œ (Jin Geum Soon)\nÃƒÂ¬Ã…â€œÃ‚Â¤ÃƒÂ¬Ã‹â€ Ã…â€œÃƒÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â¹Ã‚Â¬ (Yoon Soon Shim)\nGgwaengwari: ÃƒÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½Ã‚Â´ÃƒÂªÃ‚Â·Ã¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½Ã‚Â¸ (I Gwi In)\nJanggu: ÃƒÂ¬Ã‚Â Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ÃƒÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã‚Â°ÃƒÂ«Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â° (Jeong Yeon Bae)\n\nIn case youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re wondering, The Jindo and Sinan Intangible Culture Series was produced by the National Institute for Namdo Performing Arts (in Jindo) and manufactured by Seoul Records. The series was not released for resale. The series and accompanying books are given to interested professionals and in some cases students at the institute. The books feature full transcriptions of the recordings. Biographies of certain performers have also been produced. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve uploaded most of Jindo series (except Jindo Folk SongsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½coming next). This is the only one of the Sinan series I have at the moment, but hopefully will be able to get the others sometime in the near future. \n\nHope you enjoy.
