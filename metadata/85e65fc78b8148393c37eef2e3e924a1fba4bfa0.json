The collection is genuinely interdisciplinary, as well as international in its range, with contributors and studies from China, Japan, Korea, Italy, Norway, France, Belgium, Britain, and Australia.\nTable of Contents\n\nPart I: Reprising Mobile Theory Chapter 1: &quot;The Question of Mobile Media&quot; Gerard Goggin and Larissa Hjorth Chapter 2: &quot;Intimate Connections: The Impact of the Mobile Phone on Work Life Boundaries&quot; Judy Wajcman, Michael Bittman and Jude Brown Chapter 3: &quot;Gender and the Mobile Phone&quot; Leopoldina Fortunati Part II: Youth, Families, and the Politics of Generations Chapter 4: &quot;ChildrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Broadening Use of Mobile Phones&quot; Leslie Haddon and Jane Vincent Chapter 5: &quot;Mobile Communication and Teen Emancipation&quot; Rich Ling Chapter 6: &quot;Mobile Media and the Transformation of Family&quot; Misa Matsuda Chapter 7: &quot;Purikura as a Social Management Tool&quot; Daisuke Okabe, Mizuko Ito, Aico Shimizu and Jan Chipchase Part III: Mobiles in the Field of Media Chapter 8: &quot;Mobile Media on Low-Cost Handsets: The Resiliency of Text Messaging among Small Enterprises in India (and Beyond)&quot; Jonathan Donner Chapter 9: &quot;Innovations at the Edge: The Impact of Mobile Technologies on the Character of the Internet&quot; Harmeet Sawnhey Chapter 10: &quot;Media Contents in Mobiles: Comparing Video, Audio and Text&quot; Virpi Oksman Chapter 11: &quot;New Economics for the New Media&quot; Stuart Cunningham and Jason Potts Chapter 12: &quot;Domesticating New Media: A Discussion on Locating Mobile Media&quot; Larissa Hjorth Part IV: Renewing Media Forms Chapter 13: &quot;Back to the Future: The Past and Present of Mobile TV&quot; Gabriele Balbi and Benedetta Prario Chapter 14: &quot;Net_DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rive: Conceiving and Producing a Locative Media Artwork&quot; Atau Tanaka and Petra Gemeinboeck Chapter 15: &quot;Mobile News in Chinese Newspaper Groups: A Case Study of Yunnan Daily Press Group&quot; Liu Cheng and Axel Bruns Chapter 16: &quot;Re-inventing Newspapers in a Digital Era: The Mobile E-Paper&quot; Wendy Van den Broeck, Bram Lievens and Jo Pierson Part V: Mobile Imaginings Chapter 17: &quot;Face to Face: Avatars and Mobile Identities&quot; Kathy Cleland Chapter 18: &quot;Re-imagining Urban Space: Mobility, Connectivity, and a Sense of Place&quot; Dong-Hoo Lee Chapter 19: &quot;These Foolish Things: On Intimacy and Insignificance in Mobile Media&quot; Kate Crawford Chapter 20: &quot;Mobility, Memory and Identity&quot; Nicola Green\nAbout the Author(s)\n\nGerard Goggin is Professor of Digital Communication and deputy director of the Journalism and Media Research Centre, University of New South Wales.
