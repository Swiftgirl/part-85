Oracle, their mother, is a former keeper of the Oracle at Delphi. \nShe constantly &quot;sees signs&quot;, most of which turn out to be commonplace 20th century traffic signs and posters.\n\nXanthippe is a pervert, that is a heterosexual, in a society where homosexuality is normal. She has a crush on Socrates' friend Plato, who cannot handle her advances.\n\n\n\nCast\nStephen Moore as Heraclitus\nAlan Cox as Aristophanes\nRobert Hardy as Socrates\nTom George as Plato\nRosemary Leach as Oracle\nRachel Atkins as Xanthippe (Imelda Staunton in Series 2)\nGavin Muir as Chorus \n\n\n\nAcropolis Now - S01 - E01 - Fish\nAcropolis Now - S01 - E02 - Games\nAcropolis Now - S01 - E03 - Gods\nAcropolis Now - S01 - E04 - Heroes\nAcropolis Now - S01 - E05 - War\nAcropolis Now - S01 - E06 - Sheep\n\nAcropolis Now - S02 - E01 - Signs\nAcropolis Now - S02 - E02 - Love\nAcropolis Now - S02 - E03 - Plays\nAcropolis Now - S02 - E04 - Sons\nAcropolis Now - S02 - E05 - Sauce\nAcropolis Now - S02 - E06 - Food\n\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration        : 28mn 1s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits\n\n\n[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:120cc0999e6370d1243f363145ec17089be74d91","amp;dn":"Acropolis+Now+-+Series+01+%26+02+-+Audio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"120cc0999e6370d1243f363145ec17089be74d91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,12,192,153,158,99,112,209,36,63,54,49,69,236,23,8,155,231,77,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
