He makes a living illegally mostly by computer hacking. Then one day he meets another man by the man of Morpheus. After their friendship develops Morpheus shows him that world Thomas is living is make-believe. At first Thomas does not believe him, but then is shown evidence and also meets with a like-minded woman named Trinity. He is slowly updated from the time the world was disintegrated and wasted, devoid of all natural resources. Then in this wasteland, came android-like humans, machine-made, who enslaved the remainder of the humans. In order to create the perfect world, a fake world is created to fool the humans into believing that everything is alright in their world. Now Thomas, Trinity, and Morpheus must lead the humans to freedom, but will the android-like beings let them?\n\nAdditional Information:\nExtra Info: sup everyone this is a project Ive been working on for awhile now and i just finished it. i made this DVD9 for myself, because of my dislike for the 3rd matrix movie and how the saga ended. i gave it to my friends and they love it and told me i should upload it for others to enjoy  in this DVD9 the first matrix movie is untouched the 2 3 movie scenes were removed to create a new story and ending. i also made new menus for this DVD9. im every proud of this DVD9 and i hope you Enjoy it\n\n\np.s. i would love to hear your feed back about my DVD, so feel free to post what you think about it &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v147/deathmule/Snapshot023.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v147/deathmule/Snapshot023.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nhttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v147/deathmule/Snapshot024.jpg\nhttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v147/deathmule/Snapshot025.jpg\nhttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v147/deathmule/Snapshot026.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b118538167a705a19ea8f55df2a5a8a1914b3597","amp;dn":"The+Matrix+Resurrection+2008+XviD+deathmule","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b118538167a705a19ea8f55df2a5a8a1914b3597","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,24,83,129,103,167,5,161,158,168,245,93,242,165,168,161,145,75,53,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
