Written by Jacqueline Wilson; Read by Alice Connor. Abridged.\n\nBeauty Cookson is no beauty. SheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a plain, timid girl surrounded by super-confident, snooty girls at school. Worse than the teasing in the playground, though, is the unpredictable criticism from her father. Frequently berated for breaking any of DadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hyper-fussy house rules, as well as for her lack of looks, confidence and friends, Beauty lives in uneasy fear whenever DadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s at home. Her pretty, sweet mum is equally subject to DadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tirades. Eventually, after an unbearable birthday party and a very real fear that DadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s temper is out of control, Mum and Beauty run away.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddebacb1c2539ccabbb755716652dd00d0672b1a","amp;dn":"Jacqueline+Wilson+-+Cookie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddebacb1c2539ccabbb755716652dd00d0672b1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,235,172,177,194,83,156,202,187,183,85,113,102,82,221,0,208,103,43,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
