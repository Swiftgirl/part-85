He is a Technocrat turned Industrialist. He elected to Parliment with Congress Party Ticket. At the time of last elections he declared his assets @ Rs.299 Crores (i.e. US$ 65 mn).\n\nNow the Govt. of India, led by his congress party, decided to devide Andhra Pradesh and give state-hood to Telangana, following KCR hunger strike for 11 days (actually he was on fast for one-and-half day, rest of the days he was at NIMS hospital with IV fluids).\n\nProtesting the Telangana decision, Lagadapati resigned from Parliment and declared that he will go on fast-unto-death at Hyderabad. However, police arrested him twice on  the same day, even before he starts his hunger strike and moved him to Vijayawada in an overnight operation.\n\nHe started his hunger strike in Vijayawada and continued for five and half days without any life support, till police shifted &amp; admitted him at a local hospital. He demanded his right to treatment at NIMS, saying Hyderabad is also in India. As Congress Govt. at Hyderabad refused his demand, he left the hospital at 10:30 PM on 20th December, 2009 in high drama and resurfaced at NIMS. The Home Minister (she is from Telangana) forced the Chief Minister to suspend all the top police officers of Vijayawada.\n\nHowever, he stopped his hunger-strike on 22nd December, after too much political pressure from his party high-command, dominated by Italy born Sonia Gandhi. Now the high-command promised him to maintain status-quo of Andhra Pradesh and no division will be made.\n\nLet us see, whether they will stick to their promise, likely they will not.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec7b3c471a971b93fe5e6aa51d3e19e275971573","amp;dn":"Lagadapati+Song+on+United+Andhra","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec7b3c471a971b93fe5e6aa51d3e19e275971573","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,123,60,71,26,151,27,147,254,94,106,165,29,62,25,226,117,151,21,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
