The reunited Dokken recorded the acoustic &quot;One Live Night&quot; during their 1995 tour. Unfortunately, this album went virtually unheard at the time of it's release. MtV had no interest in any Hair Metal, so Dokken decided to do their own &quot;unplugged&quot; album\n. This intimate performance included special versions of &quot;Tooth and Nail,&quot; &quot;Into the Fire&quot; and &quot;Alone Again,&quot; as well as covers of the Beatles' &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer's &quot;From the Beginning,&quot; Interviews with the whole band and a segment with the road crew. A rare gem for any 80's metal fanatic looking to add to their collection.Size 3.41gb... NTSC.....Enjoy Reply and Seed Seed Seed Seed Please........\n\n1. Into The Fire\n2. Unchain The Night\n3.
