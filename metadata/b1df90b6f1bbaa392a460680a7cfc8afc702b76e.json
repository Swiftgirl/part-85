Mackye Gruber. The film stars Ashton Kutcher, Amy Smart, Eric Stoltz and others, and was distributed by New Line Cinema. The title is a reference to the butterfly effect, which theorizes that a change in something seemingly innocuous, such as a flap of a butterfly's wings, may have unexpected larger consequences in the future, such as the path a hurricane will travel.\n\nThe film was followed by two largely unrelated direct-to-DVD sequels, The Butterfly Effect 2 and The Butterfly Effect 3: Revelations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1df90b6f1bbaa392a460680a7cfc8afc702b76e","amp;dn":"The+Butterfly+Effect+%5BTrilogy+Bot%5D+%7E+mya752","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1df90b6f1bbaa392a460680a7cfc8afc702b76e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,223,144,182,241,187,170,57,42,70,6,128,167,207,200,175,199,2,183,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
