From South Africa to Kenya to a Darfur refugee camp in Chad, Obama explores the vast continent that is gaining increasing importance in this age of globalization.\n\nThe heart of the film is Obama's emotional homecoming to Kisumu, Kenya - his father's former home - where thousands of people turn out to greet him. In South Africa, we follow Senator Obama on a trip to Robben Island - the infamous prison where Nelson Mandela was jailed for 21 years. At a Darfur refugee camp in Chad, we see, through Obama's eyes, the devastating effects of genocide.\n\nThroughout it all, Senator Obama narrates the film, giving his own perspective on the journey and the significance of Africa to U.S. interests.\n\nAdditional perspective is included through interviews with experts on African affairs as well as with U.S. political commentators.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbcaa1b1cd9ac035c7c3d7f85dddb1bd745e1b3d","amp;dn":"Senator+Obama+Goes+To+Africa+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbcaa1b1cd9ac035c7c3d7f85dddb1bd745e1b3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,202,161,177,205,154,192,53,199,195,215,248,93,221,177,189,116,94,27,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
