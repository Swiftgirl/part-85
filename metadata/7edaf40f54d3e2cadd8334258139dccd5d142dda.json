Then theres a great hit from Santana, Phil Collins, Dan Fogelberg, an old Mary Hopkins tune along with other great oldies from the sixties, some country and more!\n\nAt some point we may have so many peers wanting to download that we might just put together an 8GB folder with &quot;everything we've got&quot;, however it \nwont make anything weve already got out there redundant and we plan to keep it all going since the 5.58GB is a greatly competent collection already and not everyone will want the additions all in one folder neccesarily. So feel free to pick and choose, and thanks all for the great help we are seeing with seeding along the way.\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\n\n\nDivX format additions this time around:\n\nA Groovy Kind Of Love\nAl di la\nBe My Baby\nBella Ciao\nCaroline\nCat Stevens - Oh very young one\nChapel Of Love\nDance To The Music\nDonna\nEverybody Plays The Fool\nEverytime You Go Away\nHappy Days Are Here Again (wvocals)\nHere Comes That Rainy Day Feeling Again\nHey There Lonely Girl\nI m Your Boogie Man\nIf He Should Ever Leave You\nIstanbul\nItalian - Tarantella\nJefferson Starship - Count On Me\nJerry, Mungo - In The Summertime\nJimmy Mack\nKnock Knock Who's There\nLet s Make Love\nLet's Twist Again\nLove Is A Wonderful Thing\nMarried But Not To Each Other\nMr. Big Stuff\nMusic Music Music\nNeither One Of Us\nNights are forever\nOne More Night\nPeggy Sue\nPied Piper\nPuppet On A String\nRed Roses For A Blue Lady\nSealed With A Kiss\nSherry\nSlow dancing, swaying to the music\nSweet Talking Guy\nTennessee Christmas\nThe game of love - Santana\nThis Magic Moment\nThumbs\nTill I Kissed Ya\nTwistin' The Night Away\nVillage People - Macho Man\nVolare Nel Blu Dipinto Di Blu\nWhat a beautiful world this would be (IGY)\nWhat Becomes Of The Brokenheart\nWho Put The Bomp\nWhole lotta shakin goin on\nYou re My Soul And Inspiration\nYou Send Me\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7edaf40f54d3e2cadd8334258139dccd5d142dda","amp;dn":"Michael+Rizzo+Chessman+DivX+Karaoke+update+folder+Dec22-09","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7edaf40f54d3e2cadd8334258139dccd5d142dda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,218,244,15,84,211,226,202,221,131,52,37,129,57,220,205,93,20,45,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
