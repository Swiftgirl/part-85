Combining elements of theater, radio, and filmmaking, they were produced at a moment when TV technology was growing more mobile and art was being made accessible to a newly suburban postwar demographic. These astonishingly choreographed, brilliantly acted, and socially progressive 'teleplays' constituted an artistic high for the medium, bringing Broadway-quality drama to all of America. The award-winning programs included in this box set -- originally curated for PBS in the early 1980s as the series The Golden Age of Television, featuring recollections from key cast and crew members -- were conceived by such up-and-comers as Rod Serling and John Frankenheimer and star the likes of Paul Newman, Mickey Rooney, Rod Steiger, Julie Harris, and Piper Laurie.\n\n\n\nREAD:\n\nThe Golden Age of Television, Act III\n\nby Ron Simon\n\nFor twenty years, the remains of televisionÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s self-proclaimed golden age lay dormant in the vaults of the commercial networks.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1310&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1310&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n================\n\nDISC ONE\n\n================\n\n\n\n# &quot;MARTY&quot; (52 min.)
