Rucker is known for a diverse repertoire, and for utilizing techniques that catch her listeners' attention, both of which have brought her critical acclaim and widespread praise from fans.\n\nBiography\n\nRucker was born and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she was a graduate of Temple UniversityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s journalism program[1]. She is of African-American and Italian descent. Rucker had been writing poetry since adolescence but kept her writings to herself until she read poetry in 1994, at PhiladelphiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Zanzibar Blue which is credited as her debut.[1]\n\nThat very same year, Rucker was invited to collaborate with numerous recording artists, and producers including King Britt, 4hero, Jamaaladeen Tacuma, Josh Wink, Alix Perez and most notably The Roots.[2]\n\nRucker garnered a reputation for unique poetry techniques and stage presence which were described as &quot;strong, vulnerable, wounded and raging&quot;. King Britt gave Rucker recognition and invited her to create her first spoken word recording, the 1994 club hit, &quot;Supernatural&quot;. Dance music fans and DJ's quickly appreciated RuckerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vocals and rhythm, which was described as &quot;mystical&quot;. According to Britt, while the original and remixes of Supernatural were continually used in clubs widespread throughout the United States, internationally, the most popular mix of the song remains the a cappella.[2]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_Rucker&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_Rucker&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOther albums\n\n\nBay IT &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Supa-Sista-Ursula-Rucker/dp/B00005N8PK&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Supa-Sista-Ursula-Rucker/dp/B00005N8PK&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9ef2b0b17a62e64c7c057d389f984b1933490fa","amp;dn":"Ursula+Rucker+-+Supa+Sista","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9ef2b0b17a62e64c7c057d389f984b1933490fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,239,43,11,23,166,46,100,199,192,87,211,137,249,132,177,147,52,144,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
