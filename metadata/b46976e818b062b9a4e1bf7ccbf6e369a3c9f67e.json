The song became Twain's first single off The Woman in Me to not hit the top 40 at country radio. The original album version is more a poem than a song, done completely a cappella. For radio airplay, the song had to be expanded lyrically and musically. It was originally released to radio in October of 1996. &quot;God Bless the Child&quot; was included on Twain's Come on Over Tour usually accompanied by a local choir, but was not included on her 2004 Greatest Hits release.

The video is available on Twain's DVD The Platinum Collection.\n\nEntertainment Weekly gave the song a fairly favorable review, giving it a B grade and saying &quot;while her sentiments are pretty naive, her pipes sound plenty experienced&quot; and that Twain gives &quot;enough passion to make us temporarily forget her pinup looks&quot;.\n\n&quot;God Bless the Child&quot; debuted on the Billboard Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks chart the week of November 30, 1996 at number 74. The song spent 9 weeks on the chart and climbed to a peak position of number 48 on January 11, 1997, where it remained for one week.
