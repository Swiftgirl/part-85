Along with his partner, Chuck Aule, he sets out to find an escaped patient, a murderess named Rachel Solando, as a hurricane bears down upon them. But nothing at Ashecliffe Hospital is what it seems. The game is based on Paramount Pictures' upcoming feature film &quot;Shutter IslandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ from OscarÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®-winning director Martin Scorsese, slated for release on October 2, 2009. The player takes on the role of U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels and interacts with characters from the film while attempting to locate escaped patients that were loosed during the recent hurricane: U.S. Marshal Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) Dr. John Cawley (Ben Kingsley) Dr. Jeremiah Naehring (Max von Sydow) Rachel Solando (Emily Mortimer) The game contains 7 levels and 20 environments of Hidden Object game play with multiple mini games throughout that span Ashecliffe and Shutter Island. The player finds clues and uncovers cryptic codes that lead not only to escaped patients but may reveal evidence of much darker endeavors at the hospital. The closer Teddy and Chuck get to the truth, the more elusive it becomes, and the more that they begin to believe that they may never leave Shutter Island. - Captivating, immersive graphics - Challenging puzzles - Play at your own pace or in timed mode\nCategory:\tGames &gt; PC\n\nTotal Size:\t146.72 MB\nInfo Hash:\t13806ae630e6dc0ca144fa407f51b6a23a721c74\n\nDate Added:\tMar 18 2010 - 21:12:03\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13806ae630e6dc0ca144fa407f51b6a23a721c74","amp;dn":"Merscom.ShutterIsland-1.0.4-MKDEV.TEAM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13806ae630e6dc0ca144fa407f51b6a23a721c74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,128,106,230,48,230,220,12,161,68,250,64,127,81,182,162,58,114,28,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
