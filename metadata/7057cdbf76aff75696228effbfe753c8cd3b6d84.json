A brief sampling of his prolific work includes: The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory; Aspects of the Theory of Syntax; Language and Mind; American Power and the New Mandarins; Reflections on Language; Rules and Representations; Knowledge of Language; The Culture of Terrorism; Manufacturing Consent (with E.S. Herman); Understanding Power; Hegemony or Survival: AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Quest for Global Dominance; and most recently, Imperial Ambitions: Conversations on the Post-9/11 World, (with David Barsamian). \n\n\nEdward Said, who has died aged 67, was one of the leading literary critics of the last quarter of the 20th century. As professor of English and comparative literature at Columbia University, New York, he was widely regarded as the outstanding representative of the post-structuralist left in America. Above all, he was the most articulate and visible advocate of the Palestinian cause in the United States, where it earned him many enemies.\n\nOther shunster posts\n\n\nSupport Democracy Now through purchasing products and making donations at www.democracynow.com ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7057cdbf76aff75696228effbfe753c8cd3b6d84","amp;dn":"NOAM+CHOMSKY%3A+%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%C5%93The+Unipolar+Moment+and+the+Culture+of+Imperial","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7057cdbf76aff75696228effbfe753c8cd3b6d84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,87,205,191,118,175,247,86,150,34,142,255,191,231,83,200,205,59,109,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
