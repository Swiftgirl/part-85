Most bittorrent sites number the two seasons after &quot;The Real Hustle does Las Vegas&quot; as series 5 and 6 respecitvely, while BBC uses 6 and 7 for these. BBC intended 'Las Vegas' to be a series of this show, not a separate show. I've labeled this as season 6 for consistency, it should be apparent by looking at the year and title which series i am referring to.\n\nHere is an episode guide: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Real_Hustle_episodes#Series_7_-_On_Holiday&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Real_Hustle_episodes#Series_7_-_On_Holiday&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0ea10420ca3a2ef7502a9e997701a0c0369ba63","amp;dn":"The+Real+Hustle+on+Holiday+-+Series+6+%282009%29+%3C+Season+6+%3E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0ea10420ca3a2ef7502a9e997701a0c0369ba63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,234,16,66,12,163,162,239,117,2,169,233,151,112,26,12,3,105,186,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
