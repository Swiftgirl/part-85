They are not mere complainers. They have a plan to do something about it. They also share a common belief in The Creed of Freedom, which is a statement of principles that guide them in their mission to build a better world.\n\nTotalitarianism is on the rise everywhere because advocates of big government have taken leadership control of the power centers within every society. Power centers are organizations and social groupings ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ such as political parties, labor unions, church groups, media centers, and professional societies ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ that hold political power based on their claim to represent their members and on their ability to lead public opinion. It has taken many years for them to achieve this dominance over society, but they have succeeded. It does no good to complain or to theorize about what should be done. As long as advocates of big government hold the power, nothing will change.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8b60959b6fc328d805af07d05e42131b753ae3e","amp;dn":"GE+Griffin+The+Quigley+Formula+A+Conspiratorial+View+of+History","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8b60959b6fc328d805af07d05e42131b753ae3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,182,9,89,182,252,50,141,128,90,240,125,5,228,33,49,183,83,174,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
