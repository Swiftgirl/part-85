Do you believe in karma, fate or love at first sight? Have you ever had an out-of-body experience?\n\nFrom writer David Hudgins (&quot;Friday Night Lights&quot;), and inspired by the book &quot;The Reincarnationist&quot; by M.J. Rose, comes PAST LIFE, a new drama series that investigates the world of the unexplained through the eyes of a doctor and a former detective who must work together to solve decades-old mysteries.\n\nDR. KATE MCGINN (Kelli Giddish) is not your typical psychologist. Confident, outspoken and highly educated, she works at The Talmadge Center for Behavioral Health in New York City, a world-renowned institute dedicated to the study of the science of the soul. After experiencing a past-life regression in her 20s, Kate became a believer in reincarnation. Using therapy and her natural gift for reading people, Kate helps solve the mysteries of her troubled clients by investigating their consciousness. She believes there are levels of consciousness and explanations for human behavior that science can't begin to explain. Accustomed to skeptics, but not bothered by them, Kate is an unapologetic believer and a force of nature who marches to the beat of her own drum.\n\nHer partner, PRICE WHATLEY (Nicholas Bishop), is a different story. A former NYPD homicide detective, pragmatic and cynical, Price is a damaged soul who constantly battles grief and guilt over the accidental death of his wife. Price feels that Kate, though not certifiable, certainly operates on the fringes of science. It's a volatile relationship, but with Price's solid detective skills and Kate's penchant for out-of-the-box thinking, together they make a formidable, albeit somewhat dysfunctional, team.\n\nAn emotional thrill ride, each episode finds Price and Kate working with their colleagues to unravel a new mystery. DR. MALACHI TALMADGE (Richard Schiff) is Kate's mentor and the center's namesake, an avuncular but gruff elder statesman who is a legend in the field of cognitive research. DR. RISHI KARNA (Ravi Patel) is the rookie of the group, an energetic M.D. who loves bad TV, Cuban jazz and driving everyone crazy.\n*********************************************************************\nDownload, Comment, Seed and then Enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:994aae3de4e8cb4f8f00b38c954059c764c922f1","amp;dn":"Past.Life.S01E01.Pilot.HDTV.XviD-FQM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"994aae3de4e8cb4f8f00b38c954059c764c922f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,74,174,61,228,232,203,79,143,0,179,140,149,64,89,199,100,201,34,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
