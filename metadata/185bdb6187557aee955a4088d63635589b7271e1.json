Surprised by such behaviour, he would hesitate for a\n   fraction of a second. This unbelievably short period of time meant the\n   fine line between death and life. It gave way for other arguments and we\n   had full cartridges of them. We would kill hundreds of enemies this way,\n   leaving behind dead bodies, with the eyes telling the story of surprise\n   and our smiling faces. \n\n   By no means was it an ordinary war. Our foe was faceless, bereft of\n   identity. The whole Vietnam was our enemy. Its climate, terrain, mud,\n   jungle, mosquitoes and short, weird inhabitants, armed with Chinese\n   weapons and unreal ideals. \n\n   In terms of military strength, we outpowered the enemy. We had state-of-\n   the-art technology, napalm, helicopters, artillery support,\n   communications, supplies of equipment. No way we could lost? Way. It is\n   hard to imagine any army capable of defeating foe who is nowhere and\n   everywhere at the same time, foe who fights on his own ground, which for\n   us was hostile, alien and hard to understand. With time, we learnt some\n   rules of that world, we grasped the gist of fighting there. However, it\n   was primarily the fight for survival. \n\n   Ho Chi Minh, the leader of the communists in Vietnam, once said: you can\n   kill ten of my men with the loss of just one of yours, but you will still\n   lose, and I shall prevail. At the early stages of war in Vietnam, we\n   treated those words as a madman's babble. Towards the end, we had to\n   acknowledge they were true. \n\n   In October 1967, having spent some time training at a school for special\n   forces in Nha Trang, I was transferred to a temporary military base in\n   Don Dien, as the leader of a distant recon squad of four men. We all had\n   been in service for long, trained in sabotage, communication and intel.\n   We were invisible to those who themselves tried to be invisible. We were\n   the assassins of killers. Ready to bite. Yet, the winter offensive of\n   North Vietnam army smashed our teeth. \n\n   In 1968, a base located on the hill outside Don Dien found itself on the\n   marching route of a regular communist army, preparing for the strike on\n   the ancient, imperial city of Hue - the Binh Tri Thien province capital. \n\n   Al. Capone used to say that you can win more if you supplement outspoken\n   words with a gun. We were not trained to give speeches. As for the guns,\n   we had plenty of them...\n\n  ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾  ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾  ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âº    ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âº ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âº    ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âº  ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾  ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾\n   Install Notes:\n\n   Extract the archives and burn or mount with your favorite software.\n   Install the game and play to your hearts content.\n\n  ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾  ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾  ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âº    ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âº ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âº    ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âº  ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾  ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾\n   Greetings to:\n\n   Everyone thats keeping the scene a safe place and to those especially in\n   Fairlight, Razor1911, Vitality, Reloaded, Hatred, Vace, Crude and Divine.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:185bdb6187557aee955a4088d63635589b7271e1","amp;dn":"The+Hell+in+Vietnam-ARMADA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"185bdb6187557aee955a4088d63635589b7271e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,91,219,97,135,85,122,238,149,90,64,136,214,54,53,88,155,114,113,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
