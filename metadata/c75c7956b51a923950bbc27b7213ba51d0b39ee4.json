Rowlf, at the piano, gives ebullient introductions and banter as he sings and plays some of his (and the Muppets') hit songs. The album was released on CD and cassette in 1993 by BMG Kidz/Jim Henson Records. The cassette release included a poster depicting Rowlf behind the scenes, recording and prepping for the album.\n\nAlthough the album was first released in 1993 (three years after Henson's death), the songs were actually recorded by Jim Henson (as Rowlf) and Derek Scott (on piano) almost a decade earlier, in January 1984.\n\nThe original recordings by Henson and Scott were re-worked by producer Robert Kraft and associate producer Chris Boardman for the release, adding a backing orchestra to the seasoned vocal and piano tracks. The original intentions for the raw tracks and the reason for the 9-year recording-to-release gap are unknown.\n\nThe album's title, Ol' Brown Ears is Back, is a reference to Frank Sinatra's 1973 album Ol' Blue Eyes is Back.\n\n\n1) Lydia the Tattooed Lady\n\n2) Eight Little Notes\n\n3) I Never Harmed an Onion\n\n4) Halfway Down the Stairs\n\n5) Memory Lane\n\n6) Cottleston Pie\n\n7) Bein' Green\n\n8) Carbon Paper\n\n9) Garden Song\n\n10) New York State of Mind\n\n11) When\n\n12) You and I and George\n\n13) Wishing Song\n\n14) Old Dog Trey","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c75c7956b51a923950bbc27b7213ba51d0b39ee4","amp;dn":"Rowlf+The+Dog+-+Ol+Brown+Ears+Is+Back","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c75c7956b51a923950bbc27b7213ba51d0b39ee4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,92,121,86,181,26,146,57,80,187,194,123,114,19,186,81,208,179,158,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
