People cannot travel unless they have &quot;papelles,&quot; a special travel permit issued by the totalitarianistic government, the &quot;Sphinx&quot;. Outside these cities, the desert has taken over and shanty towns are jammed with non-citizens - people without papelles forced to live primitive lives. William is a family man who works as a government investigator. When he is sent to Shanghai to solve a case of fake papelles, he meets a woman named Maria. Although he realizes she is behind the forgeries, he cannot help but fall completely in love with her. He hides her crime and they have a wild, passionate affair that can only last as long as his papelles: 24 hours. Back home, William is obessed with the memory of Maria. When the original investigation is inevitably re-opened a week later and William is sent back to finish the work he started, he tracks her down, only to discover she has been accused of a Code 46 violation and any further relationship is impossible.\n\nR1 America - (MGM)\n\nExtras: &quot;Obtaining Cover: Inside Code 46&quot; featurette (16:50 min)\n\n4 Deleted Scenes:\n- Tempting Fate (1:11 min)\n- The Lift (0:26 min)\n- Cover (0:24 min)\n- Hurt (0:34 min)\n\nTheatrical Trailer (2:09 min)\n\nBonus trailers:\n- Angel of Death\n- Confessions of an American Girl\n- Species III Sneak Peek\n- MGM Means Great Movies\n- Species III\n- RoboCop Trilogy\n- Dead Like Me Season 1\n- Jeremiah Season 1\n- Raging Bull Collector's Edition\n- More Great MGM Releases\n\nSubtitles: English, Spanish, and French\nAspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nPicture Format: ANAMORPHIC\nTV System: NTSC\nSoundtrack(s): English Dolby Digital 5.1\nCase type: Keep Case\nNotes: &quot;Angel of Death&quot; and &quot;Confessions of an American Girl&quot; trailers\nare before the main menu, but they can be skipped.\n\nNo shrinkage of ANY kind.\nComes with ALL artwork.
