It is a world of weird and wondrous things, a world where all things are possible and not everything is what it appears to be.\n\nIllutia began under the original name &quot;Aspereta&quot; In April of 2003. It was released mostly just as a test run to see if there was still a market for 2d mmorpgs. Aspereta became more popular than the small team ever imagined with over 50,000 accounts in less than a year. This encouraged Crazed Monkeys to push hard to meet the expectations of their fans.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:967026d26780f882c997abdc6e936583db885ba2","amp;dn":"illutia+5.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"967026d26780f882c997abdc6e936583db885ba2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,112,38,210,103,128,248,130,201,151,171,220,110,147,101,131,219,136,91,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
