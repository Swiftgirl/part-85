There is no checkmating. Once    \n    a player has collected the majority of the gems available on the      \n    board, the game ends. If capturing is enabled in the game             \n    settings, a player who captures all his or her opponent's pieces      \n    is awarded all the remaining gems on the board.                       \n                                                                          \n    Treasure Chess features a number of different computer opponents      \n    and variety of different scenarios with varying board sizes,          \n    pieces, and piece placements. A random placement option ensures       \n    that you never play the same game twice.                              \n                                                                          \n    Kids find the game very easy to learn and play, and it helps          \n    introduce them to some of the pieces of standard chess.               \n                                                                          \n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://electronzen.com/Treasure_Chess.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://electronzen.com/Treasure_Chess.html&lt;/a&gt;                            \n                                                                          \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                          \n                                                                   \n                                                      \n                                                          \n                                                \n                                                           \n                                                       \n                                                            \n                ..: iNSTALL/REGiSTER NOTES :..              \n                                                                     \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n    Use our keymaker to register the application.                        \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                          ..: iMPORTANT NOTE :..                         \n                                                                         \n      Run CORE10k.EXE to verify this release, if CRC-check fails or      \n      even CORE10k.EXE is missing - you are probably using webshit!
