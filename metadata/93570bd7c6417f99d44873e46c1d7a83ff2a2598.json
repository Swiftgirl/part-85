[Alex says he cancelled all scheduled guests so that he can talk about news]\n\n\nA lot of attention is devoted to Debra Medina's betrayal of all her 911-truther supporters.\n\n\nIn the 2nd hour Alex talks briefly with Karen Quinn-Tostado from Oregon, organizer of the grassroots April 15 national strike/boycott movement about that project.  Alex indicates his intention to have her on as a guest in the near future.\n\n\nIn the 3rd hour Alex addresses the criticism he's been receiving for Jim Cramer [globalist, Wall Street cheerleader on CNBC] running ads on Alex's show.  Ted Anderson also talks about this.  Both are very defensive -- &quot;I guess we just can't do anything right!&quot;\n\n\nAlex also takes a number of calls. \n\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
