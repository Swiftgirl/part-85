Ripped with Winamp Streamripper. This is an inspiration of Taotoad's Bluemars rip. I spent a bit less than a week ripping these 2 streams, so it should be all of the songs, or at least most of them. The quality on the songs on Nirvana Ambient Radio are 128kbps, while Nirvana Meditation Radio's are 160kbps.\n\nAs it says on their website, they care more about quality than quantity, so this isn't a very large selection of songs.\n\nI haven't included Nirvana Relaxation since the majority of the songs are just called &quot;The Best Meditation Music for all gentle - minded and elevated souls&quot;, while the rest of the songs are shortened versions that can be found on Nirvana Meditation.\n\nThis is my first rip that I made a torrent of, so if you can, please tell me what you think about it.\n\nMerry Christmas!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6049254efe0c6072036205059b49e809dcf3139","amp;dn":"Nirvana+Ambient+Radio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6049254efe0c6072036205059b49e809dcf3139","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,4,146,84,239,224,198,7,32,54,32,80,89,180,158,128,157,207,49,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
