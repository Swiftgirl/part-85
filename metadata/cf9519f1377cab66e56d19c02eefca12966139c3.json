A day that should have been nothing more than ordinary turns into a lively adventure when the kid gets lost. He meets Ion, a small-time thief disguised as Santa Claus, who tries to still a diamond in complicity with four other fake Santas.\n      Unlike all the Santa Clauses seen on TV, Ion is kind of rude and doesn't seem to like kids. However, the boy has no doubt that he is the real Santa and follows him around, causing all sorts of hilarious yet dangerous trouble. By the end, the cynical Santa and the kid become true friends, and Horatiu learns that miracles do happen.\n\n    * Official website:http://www.ho-ho-ho.ro\n    * Production year:\n\n      2009\n    * Producer:\n\n      MediaPro Pictures\n    * Sales Agent:\n\n      MediaPro Distribution\n\nFormat video: wmv","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf9519f1377cab66e56d19c02eefca12966139c3","amp;dn":"Ho+Ho+Ho+%282009%29+RUS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf9519f1377cab66e56d19c02eefca12966139c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,149,25,241,55,124,171,102,229,109,25,192,46,239,202,18,150,97,57,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
