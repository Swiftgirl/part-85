This is more from the folk repetoire, but with a wider scope (mainly later texts, not exclusively English origins).  BUT THERE IS NO OVERLAP WITH THE PREVIOUS TORRENT.\n\nI've included more information on the tunes themselves, to help out should anyone be interested in doing their own research.  Artist field takes the form of : trad(Probable tune origin, Text family by Roud number or known author).  The Roud index is hosted at : http://library.efdss.org/cgi-bin/query.cgi\n\nAlso, there is also a very good public lecture (with music) on the subject of broadside ballads, available at : http://www.gresham.ac.uk/event.asp?PageId=108&amp;EventId=730\nThere are only a few tracks on this CD with broadside origins, but you may find it an interesting introduction nevertheless.\n\nAs its Deller / Dupre again, I'll copy what I wrote to describe the other torrent, as all of it applies equally well here :\n\n__\n\n\nFor anyone unfamiliar with Alfred Deller (1912ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1979), his voice is extremely distinctive and a bit like Marmite: either you love it or you hate it!  He was key to the revival of the solo countertenor voice, and (once one gets used to his tone) he is, to my ear at least, far more suited than modern countertenors when singing from this early repertoire, being extremely expressive and effortless in addition to being simply polished.  You can read more about him here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Deller\n\nIf you are interested in music of this genre and period, this CD is an absolute must-have.  The sound quality is astonishingly good, especially considering that this is a (remastered) 1956 recording.  Beautiful stuff. \n\nThere are some sixty other albums of Deller on the Vanguard label! Do dip in and support the label if you can :)\n\nEAC / OGG (aoTuV b5d q6)\n\n__\n\n\nWestern Wind and Other English Folk Songs (Vanguard Classics)\n\nAlfred Deller (countertenor)\nDesmond Dupre (lute)\nJohn Sothcott (recorder)\n\n1.  trad (English) - Western Wind \t\t\t\t0:45\n2.  trad (English, Roud 12632) - Early One Morning \t\t2:14\n3.  trad (Scottish, Roud 3103) - Black Is The Colour \t\t1:52\n4.  trad (US, Roud 6705) - All The Pretty Little Horses \t1:33\n5.  trad (Scottish, Roud 681) - Lowlands \t\t\t2:35\n6.  trad (Irish, Yeats) - The Sally Gardens \t\t\t2:05\n7.  trad (Irish, Moore) - Bendemeer's Streem \t\t\t1:08\n8.
