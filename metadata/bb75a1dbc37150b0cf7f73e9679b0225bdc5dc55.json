follows FBI  agent Phil  Kerby on  his relentless\n        quest to bring down one of Detroit's most notorious  mobsters,\n        Tony Jack.\n\n        Anthony J.  Giacolone (Tony  Jack) owned  the city  and nobody\n        ever stood in his way. The police were paid off and anyone who\n        posed a threat to Tony or  his crew ended up with a  price tag\n        on their head.  This all changed  when David Goldberg  and his\n        family became Jack's newest  targets, Phil Kerby vowed  to put\n        and end to this extortion once and for all.\n\n        When David Goldberg fired his long time friend and Tony Jack's\n        nephew, Jimmy Callone, he never thought that he would have  to\n        face the  wraith of  Tony Jack  himself, but  he was seriously\n        mistaken. Within days, Tony Jack appeared at David's home with\n        an ultimatum: &quot;Pay us One Hundred Thousand Dollars or you  and\n        your family die!&quot; Goldberg,  not trusting the police,  decides\n        to  deal with  the problem  himself, but  his daughter  has a\n        different idea and turns to FBI Agent Phil Kerby for help.\n\n        Kerby quickly  realises that  Tony Jack  is not  a small  time\n        extortionist; his connections ran deep. The police are  afraid\n        and the corruption  is extreme. But  now Kerby, the  new agent\n        transferred to this Michigan FBI Bureau is about to make  some\n        serious changes. His first  mission: to take Jack  down, bring\n        safety to David  Goldberg's family and  return justice to  the\n        town.\n\n        Kerby  enlists  the  help of  another  local  FBI Agent,  Paul\n        Miller. They  use undercover  agents, high  tech surveillance,\n        and  insiders  to  gather  the  details  of  Jack's extortion,\n        gambling rings and crime sprees. As the Investigation is about\n        to reach  a boiling  point, one  of Kerby's  fellow FBI Agents\n        turns  out  to  be  a snitch  and  blows  the  whistle on  the\n        investigation.  Now  Kerby  is forced  to  confront  the Mafia\n        alone.\n\n     \n                                           \n                      CAST                       \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n                  Vincent Pastore    ....
