Rolling Stone magazine confirmed that the song initially featured Timbaland rapping but his verse was replaced with Flo Rida and then later Lil Wayne. President of Epic Records Amanda Ghost, said of the recording that &quot;everyoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s breath was taken away when Lil Wayne said he wanted to jump on the record&quot;.
