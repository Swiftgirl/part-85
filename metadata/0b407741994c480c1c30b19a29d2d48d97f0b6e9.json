It was the A-side of the UK single and the B-side of the US single &quot;Arrow Through Me&quot;.\n\nLinda McCartney initially developed the main riff that evolved into this song. Paul McCartney then further the expanded that basic riffÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½along with guitarist Denny LaineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½into a full song, recording an instrumental demo for it called &quot;Super Big Heatwave&quot;. The unsubstantiated rumour that Linda played drums on this track is false; the drumming was handled by then-regular Wings' drummer Steve Holly.\n\n\n\nMy find of the decade.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b407741994c480c1c30b19a29d2d48d97f0b6e9","amp;dn":"Paul+McCartney+%5BWings%5D+-+Old+Siam%2C+Sir+%5B1979%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b407741994c480c1c30b19a29d2d48d97f0b6e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,64,119,65,153,76,72,12,28,48,177,154,41,210,212,141,151,240,182,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
