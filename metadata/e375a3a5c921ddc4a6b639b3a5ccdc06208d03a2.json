What is a watermark ? Watermark is a text written on your images,   \n   this text can be a fixed text written by you or can be the content of exif   \n   or iptc metadata fields. Exif wMarker allows you to batch process all   \n   images inside a folder and automatically write over them any information   \n   taken from exif or iptc metadata fields.                              \n                                                                         \n   The text appearance can be easily customized, you can change font, color \n   and opacity or set special effects like outline, shadow, glow or emboss. \n                                                                         \n   File types supported are Jpeg and Tiff.
