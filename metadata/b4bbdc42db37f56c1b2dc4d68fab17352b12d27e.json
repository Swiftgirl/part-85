I go through so many releases, and I hope this compilation accurately shows the tracks I overplayed this year, I mean loved the most, what's wrong with me? It's something I do, every year, at this time, for fun.Anyways, I've included high quality versions wherever possible. Sorry for the length of cd2, there isn't much I can do about it, so please live with it. Please support the electronic music scene by buying your most favorite tracks, like I do. THX to Orhan for incite on tracklist, and for the best of the decade mixed! I was to lazy to do it without you. 4 years and still going strong, at least that's what I like to  think.
