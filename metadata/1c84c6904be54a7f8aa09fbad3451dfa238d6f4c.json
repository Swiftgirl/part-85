Exploring arty and progressive directions, the Earth Band was a wholly different group from Mann's earlier lineup. Unlike the heavier art rock groups that would follow (Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, Yes), the Earth Band never became burdened by its own seriousness. \nManfred Mann's Earth Band combines hypnotic instrumentals (&quot;Tribute&quot;), exhilarating original songs (&quot;Captain Bobby Stout&quot;), and three definitive covers all laden with hooks worthy of &quot;Do Wah Diddy Diddy.&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\n\n01 California Coastline.flac\n02 Captain Bobby Stout.flac\n03 Sloth.flac\n04 Living without you.flac\n05 Tribute.flac\n06 Mrs Henry.flac\n07 Jump sturdy.flac\n08 Prayer.flac\n09 Part time man.flac\n10 I'm up and I'm leaving.flac\n11 Living without you (single mono version).flac\n12 California Coastline (single mono version).flac\n13 Mrs Henry (single mono version).flac\n\nNMR.
