The unit is running firmware 3.01 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.apple.com/appletv/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.apple.com/appletv/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe video is not high quality and suffers from focus issues due to my camera being very inexpensive!  The clicking noise in the video I believe is the auto focus.\n\nStreaming is not shown in video.  You can connect up to 5 other iTunes libraries and stream from them.  Parental controls are also very good.  You can block purchasing and limit playback on material based on rating.  If you try to play something beyond rating or purchase, it prompts you to enter a 4 digit pin that you assign when you setup parental controls.  Networking isn't shown either.  It supports 802.11 wireless up to N.  Not sure if its a gigabit or 100mbit connection on back.\n\nIf you have tv shows it sorts them by show and season.\n\nI believe this is a good product and has good value.\n\nThis Apple TV unit has Boxee installed.  The Launcher and Software Menu items are not standard and are part of the Boxee installation.\n\n\nApple TV on eBay: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://computers.shop.ebay.com/Apple-TV-/168058/i.html?_npmv=3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://computers.shop.ebay.com/Apple-TV-/168058/i.html?_npmv=3&lt;/a&gt;\n\nApple TV (160gb) at Apple.com (currently $229 free s/h) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_ipod/family/apple_tv&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_ipod/family/apple_tv&lt;/a&gt;\n\nApple TV (40gb refurb) at Apple.com (currently $149 free s/h) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://store.apple.com/us/product/FA711LL/A&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://store.apple.com/us/product/FA711LL/A&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions about the unit just ask.\n\nThe entire HR collection is compatible with this unit.  You may need or want to add poster art however to the older releases to make them look a bit more snazzy however.\n\n\n-HR\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc1b16d252bd38c5ada5f1aa4cf68124d4ab8e88","amp;dn":"Apple+TV+Demonstration","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc1b16d252bd38c5ada5f1aa4cf68124d4ab8e88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,27,22,210,82,189,56,197,173,165,241,170,76,246,129,36,212,171,142,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
