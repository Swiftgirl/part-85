On this journey, they encounter a long forgotten bet, \na wedding they must crash, and a funeral that goes impossibly out \nof control. As they make their way through the perilous landscape, \nanother journey begins: their inner journey through memory lane and \nthe story of their friend--the irrepressible free-thinker Rancho [Aamir Khan], \nwho in his unique way, touched and changed their lives. Its a story of \ntheir college days that swings between Ranchos romance with the spirited Pia \n[Kareena Kapoor], and his clash with an oppressive mentor, Viru Sahastrabudhhe \n[Boman Irani]. And then one day, suddenly, Rancho vanished. Who was he? Where\ndid he come from? Why did he leave? The friend who influenced and inspired \nthem to think creatively and independently, even as the conformist world called \nthem three idiots. Where is the original idiot now? Finally, in misty mountains \nof unparalleled beauty, the friends find the key to the secret. Loosely based on \nthe Chetan Bhagat best seller &quot;Five Point Someone&quot;, Three Idiots is a comedy of \nideas that is as provocative as it is funny, as wildly entertaining as it is \ninsightful.Three idiots dares to challenge the monotonous stream of education \npersisting in India without going too much into a social propaganda but the tone \nin which it delivers is light. A laugh-riot that talks about the most important \nof human pursuits: self-actualization\n\nscreen shots &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/cALLgAacC&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/cALLgAacC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/CAlLHaacc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/CAlLHaacc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/cAlLKaAcC&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/cAlLKaAcC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/CAllLAAcC&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/CAllLAAcC&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de3444c99334f1d668ba057865a2456a3e85bd4d","amp;dn":"3+idiots_MOVIE_R5_%5Brohnak%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de3444c99334f1d668ba057865a2456a3e85bd4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,52,68,201,147,52,241,214,104,186,5,120,101,162,69,106,62,133,189,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
