It just happens to be so tragically underwritten. Who is this virtuoso, with their impeccable sense of melody, intricate acoustic guitar work and neoclassical aspiration? I really have no idea. All I know is that this album is a gem worth digging for as it rivals the very best works from the genre, including UlverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s revered Kvldssanger and the best Empyrium albums.\n\nSo what makes this masterpiece such a standout? Maybe its own reluctance to being a masterpiece is key, as its soothing compositions move with calm patience, letting each arpeggio descend and cello ache  organically. Nothing about this album can be called pretentious, overwrought or overwhelming, its performances hold a power that is emotionally resonant and deeply comforting. Its has peace and beauty to it and seems to convey scenes of natural solitude or of a love so sound that it isolates, conceals and protects itself from the harshness of the world.\n\nEven if you are familiar with other bands in the neofolk genre, like Tenhi, Empyrium, October Falls, etc., this is still worth the effort to uncover. Whereas its contemporaries are often dark, unsettling and mournful, Vali is uplifting and heartrendingly beautiful. I hope we havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t heard the last from this mysterious musician.\n\n01. Naar Vinden Graater\n02. Dypt Inne I Skogen\n03. Et Ensomt Minne\n04. Nordlysets Dans\n05. Lengsel\n06.
