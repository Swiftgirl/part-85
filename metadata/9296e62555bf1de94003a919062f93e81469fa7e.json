God redeems messed up families and raises up new patriarchs and matriarchs to create new family lines because of his covenantal faithfulness to and love for ill-deserving people. Four covenant heads are mentioned in JesusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ genealogy from Luke: David, Abraham, Noah, and Adam. Each points to and foreshadows Jesus, but Jesus is greater than all four. If we are born again in Jesus, we are added to his family line as well.'\n\nrun time: 55:38\n\nINTERNET ARCHIVE LINK: http://www.archive.org/details/MarsHillChurchJesusIsMan\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9296e62555bf1de94003a919062f93e81469fa7e","amp;dn":"Jesus+Is+Man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9296e62555bf1de94003a919062f93e81469fa7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,150,230,37,85,191,29,233,64,3,169,25,6,47,147,232,20,105,250,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
