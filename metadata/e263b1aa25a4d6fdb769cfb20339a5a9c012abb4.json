Shadow's first single, Akuma na Koi/NYC.  \n\nThis single includes the temporary unit, NYC Boys promotional support song for the 2009 Women's Volleyball World Grand Prix. NYC Boys was a collaboration between Yuma Nakayama w/ B.I. Shadow and Ryosuke Yamada and Yuri Chinen from Hey! Say! JUMP!\n\n\n1. Akuma na Koi\n2. NYC\n3. Dial Up\n\n\nAnd I see this all the time, but the NYC in NYC Boys does NOT mean New York City.  It is an acronym coined from the first letters of the three front-men's last names (Yuma [N]AKAYAMA, Ryosuke [Y]AMADA, and Yuri [C]HINEN).  The New York City thing is totally coincidental.
