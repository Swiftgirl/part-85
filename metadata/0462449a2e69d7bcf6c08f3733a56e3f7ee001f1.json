The laid-back singer hit the R&amp;B charts in a big way with the addictive, sly &quot;Lowdown&quot; (which has been sampled by more than a few rappers and remains a favorite among baby-boomer soul fans) and expressed his love of smooth soul music almost as well on the appealing &quot;What Can I Say.&quot; But Scaggs was essentially a pop/rocker, and in that area he has a considerable amount of fun on &quot;Lido Shuffle&quot; (another major hit single), &quot;What Do You Want the Girl to Do,&quot; and &quot;Jump Street.&quot; Meanwhile, &quot;We're All Alone&quot; and &quot;Harbor Lights&quot; became staples on adult contemporary radio. Though not remarkable, the ballads have more heart than most of the bland material dominating that format.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0462449a2e69d7bcf6c08f3733a56e3f7ee001f1","amp;dn":"Boz+Scaggs+-+Silk+Degrees+%5BMFSL+UDCD+535%5D%281976%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0462449a2e69d7bcf6c08f3733a56e3f7ee001f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,98,68,154,46,105,215,188,246,192,143,55,51,165,110,63,126,224,1,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
