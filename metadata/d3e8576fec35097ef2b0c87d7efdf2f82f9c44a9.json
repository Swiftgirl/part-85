Music of the movie is good including the title song which is quite inspirational.It has to be said that good level of effort has been put into every part of the movie whether it is casting or hockey(matches)choreography (which is acceptable).\n\nAlthough the winning streak of the team at the world cup may seem to an extent unrealistic but overall Chak De India can be said as an entertaining and inspirational movie and is a must watch for every Shah Rukh Khan fan and critic for his brilliant performance.[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3e8576fec35097ef2b0c87d7efdf2f82f9c44a9","amp;dn":"Chak+De+India.HQ.rahul","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3e8576fec35097ef2b0c87d7efdf2f82f9c44a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,232,87,111,236,53,9,126,242,176,200,125,126,253,242,248,47,156,68,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
