Great for the LONG haul. I loved this book and learnt a bit of what it may have been like to live in the 14th century....A bath once a week sounds a bit long though..lol. hope you love it as much as I did.Also excellent narrasion by John Lee. He will suck you right into the story the way he reads it. A must have audio book.\n\n\nBrought to you by azoozz, comment always welcome.\n\n N.B.    Also check out www.the-pillars-of-the-earth.tv  there appears to be a miniseries coming out in 2010.. I really hope they do the book justice and not hack to hell...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed44fe1fec4fde2fbf4863da3aa50e91d69d7344","amp;dn":"The+Pillars+of+the+Earth+pts1+to+5+%28Unabridged%29+%5Bazoozz%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed44fe1fec4fde2fbf4863da3aa50e91d69d7344","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,68,254,31,236,79,222,47,191,72,99,218,58,165,14,145,214,157,115,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
