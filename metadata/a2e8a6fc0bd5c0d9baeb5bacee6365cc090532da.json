This means that a paper drawing can be scanned, line artwork automatically recognized and represented in a vector format that then can be imported to your CAD or drawing program. Professionals in Cutting, Engraving, Sign Making and other CAD/CAM systems may want to take a very close look at Toolkit due to it's ability to create fine lines and outlines. Toolkit incorporates a new advances Fine Line Technology that helps to create perfectly looking shapes and designs. Toolkit has the unique special feature to refine curves. So with a proper choice of parameters a vectorized drawing composed of curves normally looks better than the original one.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2e8a6fc0bd5c0d9baeb5bacee6365cc090532da","amp;dn":"Raster+to+Vector+Conversion+Toolkit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2e8a6fc0bd5c0d9baeb5bacee6365cc090532da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,232,166,252,11,213,192,217,186,235,91,172,238,99,101,204,9,5,50,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
