After 190,000 years living as nomadic hunter-gatherers, our ancestors were forced to change with the world around them.\n\nIn Europe the rise in temperature unleashed an agricultural revolution, while in North Africa around 7,000 years ago a savage drought led Saharan refugees to settle along the River Nile. In the limited space they had to learn new skills and form new social structures, going on to found the Kingdom of Egypt.\n\nFive hundred years later this same global warming triggered catastrophe as Canadian ice sheets containing 900,000 trillion tonnes of water melted into the Atlantic, causing massive flooding. In less than a year Britain was amputated from mainland Europe, and the Black Sea was formed, washing out the pioneer farmers from that region. What happened to the people that had cultivated this fertile land changed the future of the continent.\n\nInformation for File: Man On Earth (2 of 4).avi\nGeneral / Container Stream # 1\nTotal Video Streams for this File -&gt; 1\nTotal Audio Streams for this File -&gt; 1\nVideo Codecs Used -&gt; XviD\nAudio Codecs Used -&gt; MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\nFile Format -&gt; DivX\nPlay Time -&gt; 48mn 17s\nTotal File Size -&gt; 430 MiB\nTotal Stream BitRate -&gt; 1 244 Kbps\nVideo Stream # 1\nCodec (Human Name) -&gt; MPEG-4 Visual\nCodec (FourCC) -&gt; XVID\nFrame Width -&gt; 720 pixels\nFrame Height -&gt; 404 pixels\nFrame Rate -&gt; 25.000 fps\nTotal Frames -&gt; 72430\nDisplay Aspect Ratio -&gt; 16/9\nScan Type -&gt; Progressive\nColorimetry -&gt; 4:2:0\nCodec Settings (Summary) -&gt; BVOP / Packed Bitstream\nCodec Settings (Packet BitStream) -&gt; Yes\nQF (like Gordian Knot) -&gt; 0.152\nCodec Settings (BVOP) -&gt; Yes\nCodec Settings (QPel) -&gt; No\nCodec Settings (GMC) -&gt; No warppoints\nCodec Settings (Matrix) -&gt; Default (H.263)\nVideo Stream Length -&gt; 48mn 17s 200ms\nVideo Stream BitRate -&gt; 1 106 Kbps\nBit Depth -&gt; 24 bits\nVideo Stream Size -&gt; 382 MiB (89%)\nVideo Encoder -&gt; DivX503b2682p\nAudio Stream # 1\nCodec -&gt; MPEG Audio\nCodec (FourCC) -&gt; 55\nCodec Profile -&gt; Joint stereo\nAudio Stream Length -&gt; 48mn 17s 180ms\nAudio Stream BitRate -&gt; 128 Kbps\nAudio Stream BitRate Mode -&gt; CBR\nNumber of Audio Channels -&gt; 2\nSampling Rate -&gt; 44.1 KHz\nBit Depth -&gt; 16 bits\nAudio Stream Size -&gt; 44.2 MiB (10%)\nAudio Stream Title -&gt; Audio \n\nWITH THANKS TO THE ORIGINAL CAPPER!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4b6fb5bee0e99e951bac4a510a7146d8072641e","amp;dn":"Man+on+Earth+2+of+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4b6fb5bee0e99e951bac4a510a7146d8072641e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,182,251,91,238,14,153,233,81,186,196,165,16,167,20,109,128,114,100,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
