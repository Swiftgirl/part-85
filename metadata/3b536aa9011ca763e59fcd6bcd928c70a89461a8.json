Sure, she has a quirky family: a petite, sex-therapist mother, who sports nine layers of shoulder pads and with whom Spero long shared a tiny apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side; an adoring grandfather, a dead-ringer for Albert Einstein, insistent upon videotaping her every dramatic inclination. Her habits are odd, too: as a child, she sniffed scented markers and removed her arm hair with Nair; as an adult, she continues a strangely intimate relationship with a sprawling collection of stuffed animals. Spero's juvenile tendencies carry over into her professional life as well: she regularly leaves Tootsie Roll residue on memos and sprinkles pink glitter on her boss' budget reports. This memoir doesn't reach the hilarious heights of David Sedaris, but it possesses a sweetness often lacking in today's comic fare. The book is inspired by a one-woman show of the same name. \n\nWendy Spero is an award-winning comedian and actress, and author and performer of the acclaimed one-woman show Who's Your Daddy? She has been featured on NPR, Comedy Central, VH-1, and NBC, and in the New Yorker. She has written for Esquire and the New York Times.\n\n6 CDs, unabridged.\n\nEncoded mono V6 with LAME.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b536aa9011ca763e59fcd6bcd928c70a89461a8","amp;dn":"Microthrills%2C+by+Wendy+Spero","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b536aa9011ca763e59fcd6bcd928c70a89461a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,83,106,169,1,28,167,99,229,159,205,107,205,146,140,112,168,148,97,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
