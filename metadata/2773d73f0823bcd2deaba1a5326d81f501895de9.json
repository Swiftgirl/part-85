Inside is a man he recognises as Bill Tawnee, once Indian Scout to General Sherman during the Civil War and much decorated for bravery. With him is his wife and baby. Bill is suffering from a beating he took at a trading post back on the trail. The Major takes them back to the wagons to resume their journey with them. On the train is another civil war hero, Mr. Barry. That is his version of events at least. It is not long before a few comments from Bill Tawnee show that Barry did not win the civil war single handed and the two men come to blows. Later, Bill Tawnee finds Barry's missing rifle. When Barry accuses Bill of stealing it, Bill decides to leave the train, leaving his wife and child behind. It seems there is no hope of him returning. Then events take a turn for the worse and Bill Tawney comes into his own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2773d73f0823bcd2deaba1a5326d81f501895de9","amp;dn":"Wagon+Train+-+S01ep22+-+Bill+Tawnee+Story.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2773d73f0823bcd2deaba1a5326d81f501895de9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,115,215,63,8,35,188,210,222,171,161,165,50,109,129,245,1,137,93,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
