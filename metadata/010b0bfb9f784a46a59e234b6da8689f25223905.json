The original game required a lot of micromanagement in order to succeed. So much so that it almost became painful at times, because the smallest mistake could be fatal to the entire mission, forcing you to restart the battle or reload from an earlier save. This Blitzkrieg is much more forgiving, and the focus seems to be far more on fun than on realism. Of course, the sequel still models armor thickness and keeps count of each unit's ammunition, but those seem to be secondary concerns when all you have to do is lasso a group of tanks together and blast everything in your way. Once again, it's satisfying in a strange kind of way.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:010b0bfb9f784a46a59e234b6da8689f25223905","amp;dn":"Blitzkrieg.II.%2BNoCD.Crack%2B1.5.Patch-%5B%5BKvrGa%5D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"010b0bfb9f784a46a59e234b6da8689f25223905","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,11,11,251,159,120,74,70,165,158,35,75,109,168,104,159,37,34,57,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
