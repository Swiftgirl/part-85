The exclusive comedy event is the culmination of WilliamsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ sold-out U.S. tour (his first in six years), and will be taped before a live audience at WashingtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s DAR Constitution Hall.\n\nMoving with the times and his age Robin also focuses on technology, Viagra, prescribed drugs, and his experiences in the past. A few of his jokes were from previous sets, but he always added a new twist, a new dimension that made it even funnier then the past versions.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1560169/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1560169/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d81126ec9250049ee82a99531f1c97691bca1f4","amp;dn":"robin.williams.weapons.of.self.destruction.hdtv.xvid.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d81126ec9250049ee82a99531f1c97691bca1f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,129,18,110,201,37,0,73,238,130,169,149,49,241,201,118,145,188,161,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
