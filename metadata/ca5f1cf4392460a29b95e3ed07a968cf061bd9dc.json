Catherine Bleish, &quot;You Gotta Hard On for Me&quot;   \n\n\nWMV clip\n\nMore...\n\nA planned protest turned ugly yesterday when liberty activists turned on each other at an event held on the steps of the Austin Police Department HQ regarding the APD and BATFEÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s decision to shut down the long running and legally-held Texas Gun Show on January16th and 17th.\n\nTalk show host and filmmaker Alex Jones was invited yet refused to speak at yesterdayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s protest, which was sponsored by Texans for Accountable Government, Truth Seekers, and the Ladies of Liberty Alliance. Instead, Jones co-opted the event by using his bullhorn to drown out the event's scheduled speakers.\n\nIn avideo chronicling the takeover of the event by Jones and the ensuing tumult, Catherine Bleish, Executive Director of the Liberty Restoration Project confronted Jones regarding his comment that they were ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnew activists and they didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know what they were doing,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to which Jones replied; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWell, I said that to you, yes.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nAn off-camera and unnamed activist then asked for the reason why Jones didn't work with the event's organizers, to which Jones replied, &quot;Well, I'm sorry; I brought 80% of the people here.&quot; While much of the audio is unintelligible due to ambient sound, Bleish informs Jones ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMany people worked really hard on this event,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to which Jones replied again, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYou donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know what youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re doing.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Jones also says during the exchange, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve got a hard-on for meÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be here in 20 years.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nSource: Freedoms Phoenix","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca5f1cf4392460a29b95e3ed07a968cf061bd9dc","amp;dn":"Alex+Jones+Caught+at+Austin+Gun+Rally+Agent+Provocateuring","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca5f1cf4392460a29b95e3ed07a968cf061bd9dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,95,28,244,57,36,96,162,155,149,227,237,7,169,104,207,6,27,217,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
