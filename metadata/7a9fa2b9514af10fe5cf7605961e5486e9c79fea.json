Idol is too big (XviD is 700MB) and by that unsuitable for many people... especially for the people with bandwidth limitations, as people who requested small-sized AI three weeks back and I turned them down. As I've said back then, my &quot;as usual&quot; 720p re-encodes of AI and other live shows always turns bad. Hence, this is XviD re-encode for the people willing to take trade-offs.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a9fa2b9514af10fe5cf7605961e5486e9c79fea","amp;dn":"American.Idol.S09E17.Top.10.Girls.Compete.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a9fa2b9514af10fe5cf7605961e5486e9c79fea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,159,162,185,81,74,241,15,229,207,118,5,150,30,84,134,233,199,159,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
