The company I won it from had it transferred for me to cd.\nThe studio that transferred it did it all to one track.  ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s why there is a second cdr in the transfer.\nI think this is very close to the master tape.  A couple of the reasons I think this are, would someone\nreally waste a 10 inch reel to make a copy of a multi generational tape?  Also, has anyone else ever seen\na copy with a Ritchie Havens version of a Dylan song that seems to be recorded at the same show?\n\nThis is the same recording that has been the basis for most of the Isle of Wight boots throughout the years.\nThere is very little hiss on the tape.  There are no vinyl sounds.  It contains every song Dylan played at\nthe show. It has the starts and stops between most songs that are found on all versions of this show.\nThere is another audience version that was on Pink Robert that did the same start and stop between songs.\nI wonder if all the tapers had bought into the rumor of Dylan playing for three hours and were trying to\nsave tape.  I bet if they knew it was only going to be an hour they may have let it roll.  There is no more\nmusic on this version than any other I have found. What it does have is a bit more audience here and there.\nIt also has Bob telling the crowd, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYou look great,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ after Lay Lady Lay, that I canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t find on any of my other\nsources.  I think this tape, or a version of it, served as the source for the master to the TMOQ version as\nthat version and this tape have Rainy Day Women ending at the same spot, while a complete recording of the\nsong exists from this taper.  I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t think this was used as the master for that boot, as the boot has\nthe songs out of order, and this tape has them in order of performance.  This show is one of my favorites\nand I purchased this tape in hopes of unearthing a new treasure.  While I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get that, I think I did get\na source very close to the master, I really think itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a first generation, as the sound on this is very warm,\nand the solo acoustic stuff never has sounded better, IMO.  There might be versions that eqÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ed the heck out\nof their source, but none that sound so pure and unadulterated.  I had the studio do nothing to the tape,\njust transfer it.  No noise reduction, e.q., anything.  I also didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t try to correct any of the imperfections,\nas there are some on the tape.  There is static in a couple of spots, and a couple of songs have portions\nrepeated.  IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not saying this is anything new or revolutionary, but I do think I have a very close to the\nmaster source. I was told these reels had not seen the light of day since around 1971.  They sure looked old. \nIt was bundled with another reel of the original 13 Basement Tapes songs.  There was nothing at all new on\nthat one. The owner worked for KMET radio in Los Angeles.  IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve included photos of the reel.  I paid a couple\nof bucks for these and my way of getting my moneyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s worth is by sharing them with as many people as possible. \nPlease share this anywhere you like, but try to avoid places that will make you eliminate the officially\nreleased songs. At least until itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s had a good enough time to get out as is.  Hunger City is itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s debut. \nI also hope someone will piece it together with the Pink Robert version and others, hello Self Portrait, to\nmake the ultimate/complete version.  Enjoy.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b34de8606af16bb218fc6232a899991d2b6db8e6","amp;dn":"Dylan+-+Isle+of+Wight+August+31st+1969+%28Master+%26+JTT+Version%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b34de8606af16bb218fc6232a899991d2b6db8e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,77,232,96,106,241,107,178,24,252,98,50,168,153,153,29,43,109,184,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
