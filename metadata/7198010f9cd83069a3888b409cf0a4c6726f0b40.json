After the ballet we see how Rudolf is being pushed to choose for Hungary's freedom. At the wedding-night it becomes clear how different Rudolf and Stephanie are. Then we move to 1888. Rudolf and Mary meet at a tavern and Mary is taken by his charm. Countess Marie Larisch finds a way to bring the two together and so the tragedy unfolds.\n\nWhat I liked was that they used several little things know to historians and how every actor resembled the real person. Also I liked the quote from Mary near the end and the information you get on the aftermath and how everyone involved lived after it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7198010f9cd83069a3888b409cf0a4c6726f0b40","amp;dn":"Royal+Ballet%3A+Mayerling","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7198010f9cd83069a3888b409cf0a4c6726f0b40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,152,1,15,156,216,48,105,163,136,139,64,156,240,164,198,114,111,11,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
