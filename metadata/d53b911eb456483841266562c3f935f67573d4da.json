Cost effective and easy to \n use, Part Modeler comes complete with fully associative \n drafting capability. It's the perfect complement to Edgecam \n Solid Machinist - providing advanced modelling tools to \n create parts or workholding systems such as chuck jaws or \n fixtures. The major features of a machine tool can also be \n modelled, for accurate cutting simulation and collision \n detection within Edgecam.\n          \n Edgecam Part Modeler will import and manipulate files from \n most CAD systems, including SolidWorksr, Solid Edger, \n Unigraphics NXr and STEP files. Support for IGES, DXF and \n Parasolid is also included. In addition, Part Modeler \n offers functionality to `clean and heal' and `sew surfaces' \n to quickly restore imported files that need repairing.\n           &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.edgecam.com/partmodeler&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.edgecam.com/partmodeler&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n                                                       Install Description \n\n\n  1.Unpack\n  2.Read .txt from LEGEND dir\n  3.Enjoy another Legends release\n\n\n                                                     Legendary News &amp; Info \n\n\n Legends Never Die is dedicated to bring you quality software.
