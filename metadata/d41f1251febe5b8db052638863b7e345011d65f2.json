He could have spared himself the trouble: she dumps him because her dad has decided to promote her to manager of his Milwaukee record shop, although she hasn't learned anything about the business, so Hyde is not happy - or didn't she get that right? Eric finally has the paperwork ready to study, but now Red announces his college fund is now lost on the muffler shop, and student counselor Mr. Bray is only interested in girls, especially Donna. When he finally finds a solution, it comes at the price of a year further away then either Kitty or Donna could accept. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSeason 7, Episode 23: Take It or Leave It\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½11 May 2005\nDonna is still furious with Eric over his decision to spend a year in Africa. Jackie announces she's been offered a job in Chicago - and demands Hyde decide whether they should get married. Red introduces Charlie, the son of a fellow war vet, who unwisely invites the gang to visit his father's beer warehouse. Hyde makes his choice - but Jackie has already left. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSeason 7, Episode 24: Short and Curlies\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½18 May 2005\nHyde hints he was willing to marry Jackie to stop her leaving for Chicago. New guy Charlie is in the doghouse after turning up drunk and dressed as a schoolgirl. Fes and Kelso discover Jackie is still in Point Place. Donna tries to come up with a leaving gift for Eric, who departs for Africa in three days. Charlie accidentally sees Kitty naked, but it's Red who gets into trouble. Eric's present turns out to be Donna, dressed as Princess Leia. Hyde doesn't know how to react when Jackie repeats her ultimatum, and lets her walk off, angry. Kelso offers to give her a ride to Chicago. Charlie tries to get back on Red's good side - with typically disastrous results. Kelso tries to dump Jackie at the bus station, but she demands he take her all the way. Fes tries to tap into Eric's Star Wars fantasy with Donna. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSeason 7, Episode 25: Till the Next Goodbye\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½18 May 2005\nRed and Kitty explode when they discover the guys smoking pot in the basement.
