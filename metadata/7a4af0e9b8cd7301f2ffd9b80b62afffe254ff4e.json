As the two men get to know each other, he becomes more and more suspicious of the man who is always there with a helpful hand.\n\nI can recommend CoreCodec for H264 (avc1, x264) video-playback, free DivX 7 for AAC sound-playback (and .mkv with AAC), Haali splitter (free, comes with CoreCodec) as the fastest and best combination for Windows Media Player. This is what I use.\nVLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.\nOne can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.\nQuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.\nPS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV has been reported as best combination.\nAnd please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, took proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).\nMany of movies I encode have embedded subtitles. So far, only VLC player is able to use them correctly.\n\nUSE TORRENT-SEARCH SITES, TorrentBar extension for FireFox OR EVEN GOOGLE: show-name H264\n(for example GOSSIP GIRL H264).\n\n&quot;Home&quot; of my torrents (for Bookmark/Favorites in your browser) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty&lt;/a&gt;\n\nInput: The.Stepfather.2009.UNRATED.DVDRip.XviD-ARROW\n\nSubtitles: external, English and French","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a4af0e9b8cd7301f2ffd9b80b62afffe254ff4e","amp;dn":"The.Stepfather.2009.UNRATED.DVDRip.H264.%5BREQ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a4af0e9b8cd7301f2ffd9b80b62afffe254ff4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,74,240,233,184,205,115,1,242,255,217,184,11,98,175,255,226,84,255,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
