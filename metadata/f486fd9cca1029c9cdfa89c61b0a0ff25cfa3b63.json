Using WindowsNT driver             \n             technology, Snapshot brings two new features to disk             \n             imaging:                                                         \n                                                                              \n             1. Snapshot Backup - create disk images while                    \n             Windows is running. This allows the user to work in              \n             his usual environment when backing up his data. Any              \n             device suitable for file storage can be used for the             \n             image destination, like your local drive, a network              \n             drive or any removable drive. And - most important -             \n             the image will be an industrial quality image, even              \n             though WinNT constantly writes to the disk. The user             \n             may continue to work normally, while a backup                    \n             operation is in progress; the image will still be                \n             valid and consistent. This enables one of the most               \n             important things in backup business: backup often.               \n             It is even possible to make an image backup for                  \n             servers, that must be online 24 hours a day.                     \n                                                                              \n             Snapshot Backup - Main use. Snapshot Backup is aimed             \n             at the backup/disaster recovery market. There is                 \n             little use for on the fly disk image creation, if                \n             you want to deploy hundreds or thousands of                      \n             workstations. We think however, that the possibility             \n             to do on the fly backup is very important for the                \n             end user to regularly protect his data. At least,                \n             this was our reason to create Snapshot. No need to               \n             shut down and boot from floppy, no need to create                \n             network disks, and no need to wait half an hour for              \n             the backup process - we think that's nice.                       \n                                                                              \n             2. Snapshot View - Explore saved disk images the                 \n             friendly way. The image file is presented to the                 \n             user as a virtual drive. This virtual drive can be               \n             used like any other drive, using any Windows                     \n             program, be it Explorer, Norton Commander, or your               \n             favourite MP3 Player.                                            \n                                                                              \n             Snapshot View - Main use. Snapshot View is a very                \n             easy and powerful method to explore disk images.                 \n             This technique could be easily adapted to disk                   \n             images created by other disk imaging programs.                   \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n             FEATURES:                                                        \n                                                                              \n             * Create Disk Image Backups, While Running Windows.              \n               The Backup process will back up all your data into             \n               a single file, containing all data, including                  \n               system data and registry, for total security,                  \n               should your computer ever crash. There is no                   \n               restart (to DOS) necessary. Ever.                              \n                                                                              \n             * Continue your work, while the Backup is in                     \n               progress. The new Snapshot technology ensures that             \n               all data are consistent, and reflect the PC's data             \n               at the start of backup. There are no difficulties              \n               with opened files. Ever. This enables a very fast              \n               and easy way to back up servers and other                      \n               computers, that must run 24 hours a day.                       \n                                                                              \n             * Easy Use and Restore of single Files or                        \n               directories. Drive Snapshot creates a virtual                  \n               drive, containing all your drive's data. You may               \n               use, compare, or restore these files directly from             \n               the Disk Image file. This works with any program               \n               of your choice, including (of course) the Windows              \n               Explorer.                                                      \n                                                                              \n             * Complete Restore of a disk in case of Disaster.
