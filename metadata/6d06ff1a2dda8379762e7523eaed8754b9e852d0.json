Bookends greatly simplifies these tasks. Bookends can perform Internet searches to retrieve references and associated pdfs or web pages, or immediately find and import references for which you already have the pdf. \n\nVersatile groups (static, smart, and virtual), reference cross-linking (links), multiple notecards per reference, tag clouds, and near-instantaneous live searches help organize and find information in your personal collection. \n\nHighly configurable displays let you view the reference information and attachments the way you want. Scan your word processor manuscripts to create publication-ready documents complete with bibliographies and footnotes. Import references and pdfs found on PubMed from your iPhone or iPod Touch (requires separate purchase of PubMed On Tap from the iTunes App Store). And much more.
