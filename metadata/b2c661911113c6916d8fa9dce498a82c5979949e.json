The GParted \napplication enables you to change the partition organization on a disk device \nwhile preserving the contents of the partitions.\n\nWith GParted you can accomplish the following tasks:\n\n    * Create a partition table on a disk device.\n    * Enable and disable partition flags such as boot and hidden.\n    * Perform actions with partitions such as:\n          o create or delete\n          o resize or move\n          o check\n          o label\n          o copy and paste\n\nGParted uses GNU libparted to detect and manipulate devices and partition tables. Several optional file system tools provide support for file systems not included in libparted.\n\nGParted is developed on GNU/Linux. It can be used on other operating systems, such as Windows, by booting from media containing GParted Live.\n\nGParted is free and open source software available under the terms of the GNU General Public License\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2c661911113c6916d8fa9dce498a82c5979949e","amp;dn":"gparted-live-0.5.1-1.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2c661911113c6916d8fa9dce498a82c5979949e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,198,97,145,17,19,198,145,109,143,169,220,228,152,168,44,89,121,148,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
