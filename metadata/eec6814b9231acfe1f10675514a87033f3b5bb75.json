Their politics is religion and region based which divides the people even in a metropolis like Mumbai, India. Its a story about a man who is forced to leave the city and the country he was born in due to these politics....\n\nIt's a bit topical so folks from other countries might have to research a bit to fully understand the film. Anyhow, it's a film everyone can take something out from as it involves Discrimination as a universal theme.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe file is a DVD image, so it can be burned on to a DVD or it can be viewed in VLC. Enjoy!\n\nLanguage - Hindi\nSubtitles - English\n\nP.s. - Please leave a comment.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eec6814b9231acfe1f10675514a87033f3b5bb75","amp;dn":"Goodbye+Thackeray+eternal+search+films","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eec6814b9231acfe1f10675514a87033f3b5bb75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,198,129,75,146,49,172,254,31,16,103,85,20,168,112,51,243,181,187,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
