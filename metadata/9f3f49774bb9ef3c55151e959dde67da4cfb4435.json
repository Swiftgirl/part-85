Well, now that problem is solved, with FFX-2 at least. Here is a DVD of the 10 FMV's present in the game.\n\nThe DVD has no menu (originally it did, but it didn't turn out as well as I had hoped). But does have chapters. And the best part is that unlike most you've found online these have NO watermarks\n\nDon't ask how I did it; here's the info you need.\n1) Captured with Hauppauge HD PVR (full screen with PS2 Smoothing)\n2) Videos clipped in Sony Vegas 9.0 Pro\n3) Videos merged in Sony Vegas 9.0 Pro\n4) DVD authored in TotalMediaExtreme (came with PVR)\n\nI've included a sample for those who are skeptical. It's .vob. Hope you enjoy and tell me what you guys think.\n\nDVD can be burned with a software such as VSO's CopyToDVD Manager.\n\nThese FMV's are ALOT better quality than the ones in the older torrents I posted ages ago.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f3f49774bb9ef3c55151e959dde67da4cfb4435","amp;dn":"Final+Fantasy+X-2+FMV+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f3f49774bb9ef3c55151e959dde67da4cfb4435","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,63,73,119,75,185,239,60,85,21,30,149,157,222,103,218,76,251,68,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
