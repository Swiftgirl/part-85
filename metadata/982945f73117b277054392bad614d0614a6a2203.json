The Houston Press has described the music as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½a melodic and dramatic violin/piano/guitar/bass/drum sound that often crests into mountains of orchestrated assault.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nCue began as a two-piece between guitarist/bassist/keyboardist Clarke Dominick and drummer Jason Brister. In 2000, \nguitarist Colin Swietek, part of the San Marcos indie scene and occasional member of electro-rock group The Octopus Project (Peekaboo), moved to Austin, slept under the ping-pong table in Clarke and JasonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s garage, and started playing music with them. \nThe trio released ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKeep BusyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, their first full-length album, in 2001. Later that year violinist Stacy Meshbane, formerly of The Tunahelpers (Mimicry) joined the band. \nIn April 2005, the band released ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBring Back My LoveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, their debut album as a four-piece. CueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s album and live performances have received positive reviews by the likes of Delusions of Adequacy, Tiny Mixtapes, The Village Voice, Pop Culture Press, The Austin Chronicle, The Dallas Observer, The Austin American Statesman, The Metro Pulse (Knoxville, TN), The Charlotte Observer, and more.\n\n( http://www.last.fm/music/Cue )\n\n* Disc Information\n\nLabel: Earth Gets Black\nCatalog#: Earth Gets Black 002\nFormat: CD, Album\nCountry: US\nReleased: 2005\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Post Rock\n\n* Tracklist\n\n01 - Untitled - 0:59\n02 - Handful Savants - 5:56\n03 - The Sun Has Risen Twice Today - 5:06\n04 - Every Wing All At Once - 7:17\n05 - &quot;The End Of The Rule Of Nostalgia&quot; - 5:43\n06 - Untitled - 1:11\n  * Performer [Granny Balthazar, Granny Methusela, Wine Bottle And Pilsner] - Jason Brister\n07 - New Year (Pt. 3) - 5:39\n08 - Thulsa Doom - 6:42\n09 - Granny Suite - 13:27\n10 - Bring Back My Love - 7:34\n11 - Untitled - 1:58\n\n* Credits\n\nArtwork By [Design], Photography [Sky Photographs] - Jeremy Scott \nDrums, Keyboards [Portasound], Glockenspiel - Jason Brister \nGuitar, Tambourine, Keyboards, Organ [Beat] - Colin Swietek \nKeyboards, Bass, Guitar - Clarke Dominick \nMastered By - Jerry Tubb \nPhotography [Cover Photograph] - Kent Hawkins \nPhotography [Granny House Photographs] - Shannon Dominick \nRecorded By - Bryan Nelson \nViolin, Keyboards, Glockenspiel - Stacy Meshbane\n\n* Notes\n\nMastered at Terra Nova Digital Audio, Inc.
