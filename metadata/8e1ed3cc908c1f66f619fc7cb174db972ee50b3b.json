Folk Art Found Me is a direct and humorous documentary that allows the artist to explain what real folk art is. These artists have a raw, passionate inspiration to create, entirely without pretension. In one instance, the three Naugler brothers--Bradford, Leo and Ransford--from Lunenburg County tell the story, one by one, of how they switched from auto-body work to sculpture and painting. Other featured artists are Sidney Howard, Wesley Hubley, Eddie Mandaggio, Garnet McPhail and Harry Whitney. The film includes the views of two curators, &quot;Mister Folk Art of America,&quot; Bert Hemphill and Chris Huntington. Folk Art Found Me provides a knowledgeable, visceral view of the subject, celebrating these internationally recognized artists. It snaps along with great wit and is, in the end, an inspiration for everybody.\n\n1993, 29 min 49 s\n\nDirected by Alex Busby\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106935/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106935/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e1ed3cc908c1f66f619fc7cb174db972ee50b3b","amp;dn":"Folk+Art+Found+Me.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e1ed3cc908c1f66f619fc7cb174db972ee50b3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,30,211,204,144,140,31,102,246,25,252,124,177,116,219,151,46,229,11,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
