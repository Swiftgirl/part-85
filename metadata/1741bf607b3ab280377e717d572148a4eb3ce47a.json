These costs are passed along to consumers in higher food prices. These varmints need to be &quot;controlled&quot; and rather than use poison that would pollute the water, many farmers and ranchers choose to have them shot. Watch this exciting video containing over 500 confirmed, exploding kills. Plus, learn how to approach landowners to hunt on private property.&quot;\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\nSubtitles Info\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe video is in English, without any subs. \n\n~~~~~~~~~~\nRip Info\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nA/V quality is nothing to write home about: the audio has a slight distorted hiss, and I left the video undercropped on the right side since the frame keeps shifting. If anyone has a better quality copy, and/or Part Two, don't hesitate to up that shit! :)\n\nPlease do share this file on other trackers, usenet, ed2k, and everywhere else.
