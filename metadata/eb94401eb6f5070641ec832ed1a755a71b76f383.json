I just pay attention.\nRetired Command Sergeant Major Robert Dean\n\nWhen we met with Bob Dean in May 2007 [see below], he stated that ours would be his last interview. After its publication, we received more mail - all of it generous and appreciative, without exception - than for any other interview we have ever done. We were therefore quite delighted when he agreed to talk with us on record once again.\n\nWhen we asked Bob what he wanted to discuss, he told us that he had important news, from his own inside sources, about Nibiru: the highly controversial Planet X. This video contains extremely important information for all students of Planet X to consider.\n\nTrue to form, Bob recounts other intriguing stories, including the NRO's classified discovery of &quot;a goddamn boat&quot; high on Mount Ararat, and confirmation of Henry Deacon's report that the Anunnaki are active on present-day Mars. His humanity, his dignity, his integrity and his humor all shine once again in this new video, and we are very confident that everyone who so enjoyed Bob's 2007 interview with us will find this just as entertaining, interesting, and valuable.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb94401eb6f5070641ec832ed1a755a71b76f383","amp;dn":"Project+Camelot%3A+Bob+Dean+-+Part+1+%5BEnglish+subtitles%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb94401eb6f5070641ec832ed1a755a71b76f383","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,148,64,30,182,245,7,6,65,236,131,46,209,167,85,167,27,118,243,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
