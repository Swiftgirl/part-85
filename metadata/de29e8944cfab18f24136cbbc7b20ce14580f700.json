In those 10 years, the program has investigated, uncovered, illuminated, aggravated and even entertained its viewers with nearly 200 stories. the fifth estateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s award-winning hosts reflect on some of the significant issues and personalities they covered in that time. \nThe first episode of this special series focuses on the fifth estateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unique coverage of War and Terrorism. Reporter Linden MacIntyre says: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWe tend not to follow the news agenda. We tend not to be terribly obliged to get on big bandwagons. But, you have an event like 9/11, like the invasion of IraqÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦if everybody in your audience is thinking of this subject you have to at least find some way of looking at it that might be of service.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nAmong the fifth estate stories that MacIntyre and his colleagues Hana Gartner, Bob McKeown and Gillian Findlay will be remembering and commenting on are:\n\nBEYOND BELIEF OCTOBER 2001 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ A lingering human puzzle from the ashes of Sept. 11. Who was Jiad Samir Jarrah? A quiet, pleasant young man from a middle-class Beirut family, he is also believed to have piloted United 93 and flown it into a farmerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s field in Pennsylvania on Sept. 11. Just a month after that momentous event, Linden MacIntyre and the fifth estate team produced an indelible portrait of an enigma.\n\nACT OF FAITH APRIL 2003 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ As George BushÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s and Tony BlairÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s armed forces invaded Saddam HusseinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Iraq, Linden MacIntyre investigated what possible bond could link two such disparate personalities and politicians and unite them in a common cause.\n\nCONSPIRACY THEORIES OCTOBER 2003 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Bob McKeown delved into the labyrinthine and surprising ties between the Bushes and the bin Ladens and found that even the most outlandish conspiracy theory may have its basis in a legitimate question.\n\nSTICKS AND STONES JANUARY 2005 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ In 2005, the United States was in the midst of a very un-civil warÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a war of words that pitted conservative against liberal. The new gladiators were commentators like Bill OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Reilly and Ann Coulter and their forum was the television studios of networks like Fox. It was loud and raucous, Bob McKeown reported, but did it have anything to do with the truth?\n\nTHE UNAUTHORIZED BIOGRAPHY OF DICK CHENEY OCTOBER 2004 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The real power in George BushÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s White House, many believed, lay inside the office of his Vice-President, Dick Cheney. This is the story of CheneyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vision of AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a very selective vision. CheneyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s remarkable life story involves the relentless accumulation of power in every form and Bob McKeown explored how he accomplished this and at what cost.\n\nTHE CANADIAN JANUARY 2005 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Ottawa-born computer whiz Momin Khawaja instantly became notorious when he was the first person to be charged under CanadaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s new anti-terrorist law. Hana Gartner investigated KhawajaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s transformation from a road hockey player and civil servant to a planner of destruction and mayhem in the name of Islam.\n\nLIFE + DEATH IN KANDAHAR MARCH 2008 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ In this dramatic story, Gillian Findlay and the fifth estate cameras were granted four weeks of unprecedented and exclusive access to the NATO trauma hospital at the main military base in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan.\n\nBROKEN HEROES OCTOBER 2009 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Gillian Findlay examined the reality of soldiers returning from Afghanistan with invisible wounds, post-traumatic stress disorder. She spoke with three Canadian soldiers who candidly recall the hell that has consumed their lives and with CanadaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most eloquent spokesman on the subject of PTSD, Senator Romeo Dallaire.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 349 MiB for 44mn 58s 776ms\n\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : HDTV\nLanguage          : English CA\nSubtitles         : None\nGenre             : Social Issues/Documentary\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 945 Kbps\nAspect            : 624 x 336 (1.857) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 127 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de29e8944cfab18f24136cbbc7b20ce14580f700","amp;dn":"CBC+the+fifth+estate.21st+Century+1of3+%282010%29.HDTV.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de29e8944cfab18f24136cbbc7b20ce14580f700","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,41,232,148,76,250,177,143,36,19,108,187,199,178,12,225,69,128,247,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
