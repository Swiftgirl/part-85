Originally designed to play LucasArts adventure games that use the SCUMM system (the VM in the name stands for virtual machine), it now also supports a variety of non-SCUMM games by companies like Revolution Software and Adventure Soft. \n  \nScummVM is a reimplementation of the part of the software used to interpret the scripting languages such games used to describe the game world rather than emulating the hardware the games ran on; as such, ScummVM allows the games it supports to be played on platforms other than those for which they were originally released.\n\nScummVM was originally written by Ludvig Strigeus (creator of Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ÂµTorrent). Released under the terms of the GNU General Public License, ScummVM is free software.\n  \nNote: In some games, if presented with a copy protection challenge, try entering any answer. Chances are that it will work ;-)  \n\nScummVM is based on SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) and will run on many different platforms, processor architectures, and operating systems including Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.\n______________________________________________________________________\n\n'Built on LT technology' ... This release will be at its most useful \nif using LastOS Team's SetupS or ssWPI\n\nPlease read the included &quot;.app&quot; or &quot;.ppg&quot; file for details about the \nassociated application or game, such as description, shortcuts and \nlinks, and other installation details.
