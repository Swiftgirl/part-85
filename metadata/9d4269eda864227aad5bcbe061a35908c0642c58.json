However, through the years he also had opportunities to record with American stars. In some cases, they were added to a Quintet date, and in others, he was part of an all-star group. This three-CD set, released in 1998, has 57 performances; all but the final four numbers are from 1935-1940, with quite a few cut in 1937. The value of this wonderful set to collectors depends on how much Django Reinhardt they already have in their collections, as every performance has been reissued in the past. For those listeners who do not own many of these sessions, the selections are essential, since Reinhardt and his guests are consistently inspired by each other's presence. Among the American stars who are featured along with Reinhardt (and frequently Grappelli) are Coleman Hawkins, Frank &quot;Big Boy&quot; Goudie, Bill Coleman, Freddy Taylor, Benny Carter, Dicky Wells, Eddie South, Larry Adler, Rex Stewart, Barney Bigard, and Arthur Briggs. The selections are fortunately in chronological order, and each of the 17 recording sessions is reissued in complete form. An extremely well done reissue.\n\nDisc: 1\n1.
