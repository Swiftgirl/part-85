John Bell of Widespread Panic adds his distinctive \nvocal touch to the Van Morrison classic &quot;And It Stoned Me,&quot; and this version of &quot;Revival&quot; \nstretches out and goes unusual places.\n\nHowever, the &quot;Mountain Jam&gt;Smokestack Lightning&gt;JaMaBuBu&gt;Mountain Jam&quot; \nsequence is what really sets this show apart.  Over 30 minutes of musical bliss!  After \nrocking the first half of &quot;Mountain Jam,&quot; the band glides effortlessly into the laid-back \nblues groove of &quot;Smokestack Lightning.&quot;  Jamband legend Col. Bruce Hampton whipped \nthe crowd into a frenzy with his passionate vocals, as if he was channeling the spirit of \nHowlin' Wolf himself!  Then, after a great bass and drums segment, the band comes charging \ninto the second half of &quot;Mountain Jam&quot; and Derek reaches for the stars on the famous slide solo \nthat so many fans know from the Eat A Peach version.  Best &quot;Mountain Jam&quot; of 2009?  \nYou be the judge!\n\n&quot;Black Hearted Woman&quot; is rarely played as an encore, but after this show, maybe \nit should be!  This powerhouse version is like a runaway train, building momentum \nconstantly until the heart-stopping climax and setting a very high bar for Widespread Panic's \nclosing set.  Oh yeah!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44c8aa35ccacf29a23bae942fa553282910d97f6","amp;dn":"The+Allman+Brothers+-+LIVE+10%2F10%2F2009+%5B320k+MP3%5D+Birmingham","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44c8aa35ccacf29a23bae942fa553282910d97f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,200,170,53,204,172,242,154,35,186,233,66,250,85,50,130,145,13,151,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
