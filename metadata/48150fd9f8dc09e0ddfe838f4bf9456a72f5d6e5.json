It was made on an Ableton Live setup ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ so it was full of added samples and the 73min mix consisted of as many as 19 tracks (thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 3:45 per track).\n\nI didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know about harmonic mixing then. I hadnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t yet devised DJ notation. But by careful track pre-selection, I was able to come up with some pretty neat transitions and a really enjoyable set.\n\nThe day before yesterday, I found the master CD in my old stuff. Unfortunately, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s taken some damage since 4 years ago and I wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t able to find the original recording anywhere on my harddrives. Also, it seems IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve lost the tracklist, and some of the tracks are now totally strange to me.\n\nBut anyways, here it is: Monster. One of my earliest full-CD mixes. Made in Japan.\n\n\nThe intro track (#1) is a sample taken from Monster (ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â³ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¹ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¿ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â¼), the anime series by NTV. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not a big anime fan but I really recommend this one. The other samples throughout the set are taken from all over the place.\n\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll update this place with a full tracklist once IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve got all the pieces together.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.philipage.com/monster-from-the-past/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.philipage.com/monster-from-the-past/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48150fd9f8dc09e0ddfe838f4bf9456a72f5d6e5","amp;dn":"Philip+Age+--+Monster+%282006%2C+made+in+Japan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48150fd9f8dc09e0ddfe838f4bf9456a72f5d6e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,21,15,217,248,220,9,224,221,254,131,143,75,249,69,106,114,245,214,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
