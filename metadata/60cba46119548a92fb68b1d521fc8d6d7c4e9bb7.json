Produced by Atsushi Inaba, MADWORLD has a unique black and white style depicting an incredibly sharp backdrop that straddles graphic novels and 3D worlds. As players battle opponents, they must master the use of various weapons and items found within their environment, such as chainsaws and street signs, while entertaining sports commentary adds to the third-person gameplay. With its irreverent humor and over-the-top violence, MADWORLD will deliver a unique core gaming experience currently missing on the Wii system.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60cba46119548a92fb68b1d521fc8d6d7c4e9bb7","amp;dn":"Madworld+%5BPAL%5D+%5BWiiTorrentZ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60cba46119548a92fb68b1d521fc8d6d7c4e9bb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,203,164,97,25,84,138,146,251,104,177,213,33,252,141,109,124,78,155,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
