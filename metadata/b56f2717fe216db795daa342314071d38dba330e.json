However, if you have any issues, please, leave a comment and I'll try to fix them.\n\nIn all the currently available torrents of &quot;Zoe's Tale,&quot; I've found a couple of the files half-way through the book are corrupted. I found this version on Rapid Share that has the files in tact. It's divided into 5 .rars that when decompressed give you 2 Mp3 files (~3 and ~6 hours, respectively).\n\nI've included a folder that has both parts broken up into ~30 minute blocks for easier bookmarking.\n\n\nAs always, PLEASE SEED.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b56f2717fe216db795daa342314071d38dba330e","amp;dn":"John+Scalzi%3A+Zoe%5C%27s+Tale","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b56f2717fe216db795daa342314071d38dba330e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,111,39,23,254,33,109,183,149,218,163,66,49,64,113,211,141,186,51,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
