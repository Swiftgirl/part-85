For those of you that are unfamiliar with how torrents work, to SEED you must leave the torrent file open in your client. So, you are essentially &quot;sharing&quot; the file you have downloaded with other people. You can also change your settings to allow more bandwidth for uploading to others. If there aren't enough people seeding this mix, the artist will not continue to upload these torrents.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nDJ FM - Rolls Royce of Remixes Volume 1 \n\n320 Kbs\n\nDJ FM is a producer, scratch DJ and recording artist from Idaho.
