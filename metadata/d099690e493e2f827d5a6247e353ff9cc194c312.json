As he enters, however, the doors locks behind him and he is forced to journey throughout the entire house while looking for answers as well as means of escaping it. Along the way he meets up with the psychic woman Rebecca Trevisard who provides Adam with guidance as they work together in trying to escape. Adam soon discovers the house contains portals to several different universes, and that he is the Chosen One who must prevent the final apocalypic battle between the forces of good and evil.\n\nThe game has over 40 hours of content and includes many different universes to travel, and has a plot which involves multiple sides fighting for their own causes. The beginning gives the idea of Adam being against demonic forces, but later on player finds himself caught in much deeper plot between different forces, where demons play only one role.\n\n\nGameplay\n--------\nRealms of the Haunting features first-person shooter and point-and-click adventure gameplay elements. The game takes place in a 3-dimensional world, in which the player explores locations and battle demons from a first-person perspective. At the same time, the game features a floating cursor with which to interact with the game world, such as to examine objects or pick up items. Like most point-and-click adventures, the game features many inventory-based puzzles.\n\nLike many CD-ROM based games of the late 1990s, Realms of the Haunting features extensive use of full-motion video cutscenes, which utilize live-action actors.\n\n\nPC Gamer magazine gave it 86/100, PC Zone a 96/100, and PC Player magazine gave it a 90/100","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d099690e493e2f827d5a6247e353ff9cc194c312","amp;dn":"RoTHaunting","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d099690e493e2f827d5a6247e353ff9cc194c312","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,153,105,14,73,62,47,130,125,90,98,71,227,83,255,156,193,148,195,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
