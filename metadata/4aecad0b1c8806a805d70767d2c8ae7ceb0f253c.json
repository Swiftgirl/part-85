The opening &quot;Juliet&quot; establishes a dark, moody atmosphere immediately bolstered by the intriguing &quot;Painful Struggle,&quot; with its eerie vibes and Kabok's extended bass bridge. &quot;Moorish Mode&quot; is Gordon's star turn, highlighted by an impressively restrained drum break. But it's the most overtly rock-influenced cuts that make Advancement worth seeking out, in particular &quot;Fall Out,&quot; an impressively heady mTlange of jazz, hard rock, and psychedelia.\n~ Jason Ankeny, All Music Guide\n\nBitrate: 224kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4aecad0b1c8806a805d70767d2c8ae7ceb0f253c","amp;dn":"Advancement+-+The+Advancement+%28us+1969%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4aecad0b1c8806a805d70767d2c8ae7ceb0f253c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,236,173,11,28,136,6,168,5,215,7,103,210,200,174,124,235,15,37,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
