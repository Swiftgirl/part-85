UserGate is a flexible yet very powerful program that can be used in small- and mid-sized companies instead of relying on large and expensive hardware or software alternatives. With UserGate, you can enforce as strict an Internet access policy as you want, to ensure that the Internet is used appropriately in your company. The integrated BrightCloud Service allows you to apply web filters, and helps boost employee productivity by giving you total control over what sites your employees can access.\n\nUserGate incorporates NAT and application-layer proxy capabilities and works as a point of entry to the Internet for a local network. You can share Internet access among employees in your company, use multiple ISPs, and manage traffic to avoid traffic congestion and make effective use of an existing Internet connection. With DHCP server support, you can make UserGate dynamically assign IP-addresses in your local network. The resource publishing feature enables you to provide access to your companys internet resources from the outside. Finally, UserGate is capable of working with multiple ISPs, switching users to the secondary connection when the primary connection is broken, as well as routing different users to different ISPs.\n\nKey features:\n Dual antivirus protection\n Advanced firewall\n Advanced NAT driver\n VPN connection support\n User-based access management\n Categorized URL filtering\n Application filtering\n Speed limitations and traffic quotas\n Traffic monitoring and reporting\n Web statistics client\n Billing system\n Internet connection sharing\n Proxy servers\n Multiple ISPs and connection failover\n Traffic manager\n Web caching\n IP telephony support\n DHCP server support\n Routing\n Resource publishing\n Remote administration","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d3bbbd52ef7f03f2607184442159e4608cf5013","amp;dn":"UserGate+Proxy+%26+Firewall+v4.3.949+Retail","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d3bbbd52ef7f03f2607184442159e4608cf5013","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,59,187,213,46,247,240,63,38,7,24,68,66,21,158,70,8,207,80,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
