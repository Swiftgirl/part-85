It was released on October 27, 2009 in the U.S.\n\nThe music video for the song begins with an out-of-focus view of Wade, seemingly alone, coming up a hill towards the camera. When he stops and starts singing, the camera comes into focus and the other band members come out from behind him and start lip-synching his vocals. A group of people pull up in cars and they also lip-synch the song, as well as other activities throughout the video.\n\nSmoke and Mirrors is Lifehouse's fifth studio album which is set to be released on February 2, 2010.
