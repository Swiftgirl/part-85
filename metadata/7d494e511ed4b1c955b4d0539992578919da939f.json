Mark is highly ambitious and wants to pursue the fighting in search of the ultimate shot but David has had enough of it all and leaves to go home to his pregnant wife Diane. When Mark returns bloody and bruised to his home in Ireland a few days later, he is shocked to hear David hasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t made it home. Exhausted, disorientated, obsessed by ghosts of violence and unable to pick up his old life with Elena, the man visibly deteriorates. In hospital, the doctors conclude that his paralysis is a psychological problem linked to something that happened to David, which Mark does not want to remember. It will be discovered by Joaquin, an elder psychiatrist specializing in war injuries who previously worked in the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œrecoveryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of war criminals after the Spanish Civil War.\n\n *** Small-sized 2-pass re-encode of DVDrip for computers (PC, Mac), PS3 or Xbox, portable and mobile devices (Ipod, Itouch) . ***\n*** Video is 480x272 H264; audio is 44.1 kHz/stereo AAC LC and container is MP4. ***\n\nI recommend CoreCodec for H264 (avc1, x264) video-playback, free DivX 7 for AAC sound-playback (and .mkv with AAC), Haali splitter (free, comes with CoreCodec) as the fastest and best combination for Windows Media Player. This is what I use.\nVLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.\nOne can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.\nQuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.\nPS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.\nAnd please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).Many of movies I encode have embedded subtitles. So far, only VLC player is able to use them correctly.\n\n&quot;Home&quot; of my torrents (for Bookmark/Favorites in your browser) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d494e511ed4b1c955b4d0539992578919da939f","amp;dn":"Triage.2009.DVDRip.H264%5BREQ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d494e511ed4b1c955b4d0539992578919da939f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,73,78,81,30,212,177,201,85,180,208,83,153,146,87,137,25,218,147,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
