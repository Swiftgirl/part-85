Far as I know they don't offer \nsupport, but with some general knowledge in ASP it can be a good forum. I have modified some of the database threads to work with SQL 2005, and added a online games\nsection. Its a nice setup! This file is virus free. The previous hosting decided to pack up a sell the domain, you can go here for the demo: http://gmlportal.somee.com\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec9f57674b2c13e2ae3b72893fd4b0e6cbe6f2ca","amp;dn":"GML+Portal%2C+Snitzforums%2C+ASP%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec9f57674b2c13e2ae3b72893fd4b0e6cbe6f2ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,159,87,103,75,44,19,226,174,59,114,137,63,212,176,230,203,230,242,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
