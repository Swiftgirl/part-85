At the same time, Oher's presence in the Touhys' lives leads them to some insightful self-discoveries of their own. Living in his new environment, the teen faces a completely different set of challenges to overcome. As a football player and student, Oher works hard and, with the help of his coaches and adopted family, becomes an All-American offensive left tackle.  \n\nCast\n\n\tSandra Bullock\t... \tLeigh Anne Tuohy\n\n\tTim McGraw\t... \tSean Tuohy\n\n\tQuinton Aaron\t... \tMichael Oher\n\n\tJae Head\t... \tS.J.
