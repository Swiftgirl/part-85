Well just this week, theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve offered them both insult and injury! The injury part is ongoing: Senator Jim Bunning is continuing his successful quest to deny unemployment benefits to hundreds of thousands of Americans.  Jim Bunning is a one-man WMOÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Weapon of Mass Obstruction. Thanks to him, a Senate that had been grinding to a halt suddenly came screeching to a halt.\n\nAfter Bunning injured the unemployed, the subsequent insult was provided by Arizona Senator Jon Kyl. Yesterday on the Senate floor, Kyl said ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcontinuing to pay people unemployment compensation is a disincentive for them to seek new work.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½  Yeesh. That sounds like something that Ebenezer Scrooge says in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA Christmas Carol,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ right after the bit about ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdecreasing the surplus population.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m almost surprised Senator Kyl didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t go on to ask ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAre there no prisons? Are there no workhouses?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Somebody needs to send Senator Kyl a series of visitations from spirits. His approach to the problem of unemployment seems very 18th century British. If we donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have enough prisons and workhouses, maybe he thinks we should just take all of our jobless people and ship them off to Australia. \n\nKyl is the Republican whipÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s certainly lashing out. HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also upset ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbecause people are being paid even though theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re not working.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Paid for not working? Senator Kyle! I think you just described a United States Senator! The only one I see doing anything right now is Jim BunningÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and everything heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s doing is wrong. But back to Senator Kyl: I would also point out that workers pay INTO the unemployment system while theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re working so that they have that safety net. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s why itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s called unemployment insurance, Senator. But then if Republican Senators understood the concept of insurance, we wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be having all these problems over health insurance, now would we? The bottom line is that nobody is trying to make ends meet on unemployment compensation because itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a secret path to riches. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s barely enough to get byÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and thanks to Jim Bunning, for a lot of unemployed people right now, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s absolutely nothing at all.
