What Really Happened is proud to be one of the oldest political blogs on the net.\nRivero runs the WhatReallyHappened radio show on GCN six days a week, and makes good use of his sharp wit to help his blog visitors and radio listeners not only to read/hear the news but to understand what IS really happening. \n\n===============================================================\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f79383e9e4e0db5a2ab074f129bff2d6dfc4adc","amp;dn":"What+Really+Happened+-+Mar+04+TH+%5Bsebaygo1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f79383e9e4e0db5a2ab074f129bff2d6dfc4adc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,121,56,62,158,78,13,181,162,171,7,79,18,155,255,45,109,252,74,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
