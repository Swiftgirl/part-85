Don't worry: If you loved Supreme Commander, the sequel still offers the tactical flexibility and enormous scope you were expecting, albeit tempered by a bit of economic streamlining. But SupCom 2's not just a retread of what's come before; it's a slick retooling of classic gameplay that happily and successfully embraces both complexity and user friendliness. This is an inviting package for both veterans and newcomers--intricate enough to keep your mind nimble but welcoming even to those daunted by the original's magnitude. Most importantly, it's great fun, letting you play with a variety of interesting units and giving you lots of room to experiment with all the tactical possibilities. The strategic joy doesn't go unhindered; pathfinding headaches and predictable AI keep Supreme Commander 2 from having the sharp cerebral edge of its predecessor. Yet, while not quite as special as its fantastic forebear, it still stands out for its fluid gameplay, excellent multiplayer maps, and the thrill of emerging victorious after an hour-long battle of wits. \n:\n:\n:...&gt; System Requirements\n:\n    MINIMUM PC SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\n\n    OS: Windows XP/Vista/Windows 7\n    Processor: 2.6 GHz Memory: 1GB RAM (XP) 1.5GB RAM (Vista/Windows 7)\n    Video: 256 MB VRAM DX9 compliant with Pixel Shader 3.0\n    DirectX Support: DirectX 9.0\n    Sound: No accelerated sound hardware required\n    Hard Drive: 4-5 GB, for full install &amp; DirectX\n    Internet Connection: Cable/Broadband\n\n    RECOMMENDED PC SYSTEM CONFIGURATION\n\n    OS: Windows XP/Vista/Windows 7\n    Processor: 3.0 GHz Dual Core AMD or better\n    Memory: 2GB RAM\n    Video: ATI Radeon X1800 or equivalent card with 256 MB VRAM with Pixel Shader\n    3.0\n    DirectX Support: DirectX 9.0\n    Sound: No accelerated sound hardware required\n    Hard Drive: 4-5 GB, for full install &amp; DirectX\n    Internet Connection: Cable/Broadband\n:\n::\n:::...&gt; how to install\n:\n1...: Double click Setup.exe, wait then press 'c' to choose an installation \n      location (make sure there are no spaces in the installation location) or \n      press 'i' to default install to 'System drive:GamesTPTBGameName'.\n\n      \n:\n2...: Wait,\n:\n3...: Play Game from Desktop!\n:\n:\n:...: THIS IS A FULL RIP AS IN FULL NOTHING HAS BEEN REMOVED OR RECODED SO YOU \n      WONT HAVE TO DOWNLOAD A SEPARATE '3 PART ADDON' FROM SENDSPACE.....
