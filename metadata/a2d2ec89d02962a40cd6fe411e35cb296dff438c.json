Two planetary decontaminationists accidentally cause the Earth to melt\n\nSet in the year 2150, Arnold and Gregor work as planetary decontaminationists via their own firm, AAA Ace Eco-Friendly Interplantary Decomtamination. Their job is to clean up polluted planets and to make them habitable for humans. One such place is Planet Party, where several people have died when they landed there. With a big cash award given to anyone who can clean it up, it looks like Arnold and Gregor might do the deadly job.\n\nHowever, they soon get sidetracked by an alien music box which contains a strangle liquid which dissolves anything it touches. It is not long before the 87th floor of a skyscraper in Streatham starts to melt, followed by London, and soon the entire Earth.\n\nAccording to the song in the music box, the only thing that can stop the melting is something called &quot;The Laxian Key&quot;.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/radio/the_laxian_key/episodes/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/radio/the_laxian_key/episodes/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nStarring:\nChris Larner\nMark Bonar\nChristine Kavanagh\nAlex Lowe\nVirginie Gilchrist\nTrevor Cooper\nBethan Walker\nSam Dale\n\nWriters:\nRobert Sheckley, Chris Larner, David Gilbert\n\n\n\nThe Laxian Key - S01 - E01\nThe Laxian Key - S01 - E02 \nThe Laxian Key - S01 - E03 \nThe Laxian Key - S01 - E04 \n\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration Approx : 28mn 0s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits\n\n\n[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2d2ec89d02962a40cd6fe411e35cb296dff438c","amp;dn":"The+Laxian+Key+-+Audio+Sci-fi+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2d2ec89d02962a40cd6fe411e35cb296dff438c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,210,236,137,208,41,98,164,12,214,254,65,30,53,203,41,109,255,67,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
