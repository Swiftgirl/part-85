Delicate, bell-like arpeggiated guitars weave around snaking clarinet and flute, while the beautifully held back yet sanguine rhythm section drives the whole thing into a blurred, sun-soaked horizon. \n\nTheir debut album features the wonderfully received single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Pouring Milk Out The WindowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, an anthem without ever having to be anthemic, a melancholic reverie that never resorts to the emotional ease of sadness. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“If You CanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Join Them, Beat ThemÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, which featured on the 2009 Spunk Singles Club compilation album, is another chiming standout. And gorgeous closing track ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Halfway HouseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ weaves in bubbling electronics as the band lead the listener through glowing landscapes and light-drenched vistas.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n1 A Public Space  \n2 If You CanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Join Them, Beat Them \n3 Trout Fishing In Australia  \n4 Pouring Milk Out The Window\n5 Car Crash \n6 Wadnama \n7 Rain Falls On Your Nose, ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Red From The Cold \n8 The Parachute Failure \n9 On The Trolley \n10 Halfway House \n\nMP3, 256kbps.\n\n\nSeed please!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60322feb43178650d760374defafe5a9ab2751ee","amp;dn":"Apricot+Rail+%28Self-titled+Album%29+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60322feb43178650d760374defafe5a9ab2751ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,50,47,235,67,23,134,80,215,96,55,77,239,175,229,169,171,39,81,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
