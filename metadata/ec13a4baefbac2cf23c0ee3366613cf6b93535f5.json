The concept is to create an image and to imbue it with your desires. Then by sending this image out into the world, you're supposed to be able to get whatever it was that you wanted. This is the nature behind corporate logos.\n\nThe video shows how Grant Morisson used sigil magik and/or the Gaia Sophia Mysteries to try to create an end times/tribulation scenario where Super Heroes from another universe are summoned to save planet Earth from an Antichrist.\n\nThe weird part is that in doing this, Morrison is by his own design, attempting to summon an Antichrist and great destruction upon the Earth as a means of setting the stage to have the planet saved by these super beings from other dimensions.\n\nFor more on Sigil Magik... from a Christian perspective check out:\n\nWise as Serpents: The Gaia Sophia Mysteries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://recordings.talkshoe.com/TC-20318/TS-248251.mp3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://recordings.talkshoe.com/TC-20318/TS-248251.mp3&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWise as Serpents: A Kind of Magic &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://recordings.talkshoe.com/TC-20318/TS-262618.mp3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://recordings.talkshoe.com/TC-20318/TS-262618.mp3&lt;/a&gt;\n\n  ____                      _                      _   _       _\n / ___|___  _ __  ___ _ __ (_)_ __ __ _  ___ _   _| | | |_   _| |__\n| |   / _ \\| '_ \\/ __| '_ \\| | '__/ _` |/ __| | | | |_| | | | | '_ \\\n| |__| (_) | | | \\__ \\ |_) | | | | (_| | (__| |_| |  _  | |_| | |_) |\n \\____\\___/|_| |_|___/ .__/|_|_|  \\__,_|\\___|\\__, |_| |_|\\__,_|_.__/\n                     |_|                     |___/\n   ____\n  / ___|___  _ __ ___\n | |   / _ \\| '_ ` _ \\\n | |__| (_) | | | | | |\n(_)____\\___/|_| |_| |_|\n\n\nPLEASE KEEP SEEDED TO PASS ON MESSAGE.
