I wondered what down-loaders of these were doing with them. What I did \n\nwas to display them at the top of the screen while trying to ignore years of \n\ninstinct in looking for them at the bottom. It gave me a headache.\n\n\nSo I searched and found a piece of software designed to delete such burned-in \n\nsubtitles. It worked--sort of. The results are displayed herein. What remains \n\nevident, is a jagged scar much less distracting than the original. In fact, \n\ndepending on the background scene, it can be invisible. But in too many cases, \n\nenough debris remains to leave something to be desired.\n\n\nAt any rate, now other people around the world can plug in their local language\n\nand better enjoy this third Bronte sister BBC costume drama. Read the text file.\n\n\n\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e79d25edc3daa943a8fe288f2e71095fe3ed51a5","amp;dn":"The+Tenant+of+Wildfell+Hall+%281996%29++w%2FENG+SUBS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e79d25edc3daa943a8fe288f2e71095fe3ed51a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,157,37,237,195,218,169,67,168,254,40,143,46,113,9,95,227,237,81,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
