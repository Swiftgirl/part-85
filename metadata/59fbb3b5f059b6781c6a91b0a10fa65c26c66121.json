It's been greatly improved over 1, but it's still not complete. Milestone 2 will come when I'm ready to do some major 3d modelling work, and that might not be for a while. Milestone 3 will be when I start to code, but that's a long way off. For now, the game is fairly polished and playable.\n\nAs before, to install and play:\n\n1) Unpack .7z files.\n2a) Run nozone.bat to start the game.\n2b) Or server.bat to start a local server.\n\nAgain my testing server at 80.177.160.241 will be up peridoically. I desprately need beta testers now, so please join. Please? Preetty please with a great big cherry on top? Ah, fuck you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59fbb3b5f059b6781c6a91b0a10fa65c26c66121","amp;dn":"%5B%5B%5BNoZone%5D%5D%5D+Milestone+1B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59fbb3b5f059b6781c6a91b0a10fa65c26c66121","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,251,179,181,240,89,182,120,28,106,145,176,161,15,166,92,38,198,97,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
