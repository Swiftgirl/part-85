They live in a filthy, rundown house, although it has working electricity and running water. There is never a human owner visible or even evident.\n\nThe episodes are self-contained, and set entirely within the house. Most of the events that take place tend to be surreal, contain strong elements of black comedy and off-colour humour, and frequently make references to pop culture subjects.\n\nPets also follows a rather traditional sitcom technique by using a &quot;reset button&quot;. Each of the Pets have died at least once, only to reappear alive and well in the next episode. Events from previous episodes are never referred to, but unseen events from the past are often mentioned.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79a21c6dc2b1f79c875847b52ae77245222de3e4","amp;dn":"Pets+-+Christmas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79a21c6dc2b1f79c875847b52ae77245222de3e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,162,28,109,194,177,247,156,135,88,71,181,42,231,114,69,34,45,227,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
