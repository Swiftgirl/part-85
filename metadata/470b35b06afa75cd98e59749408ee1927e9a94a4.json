All the old rules\nare still valid, unless they have been altered or updated by this addendum.\n\nThe 0day scene has gone through major changes in this decade. As technologies\nhave changed, so have we, but our adaptations have left many grey areas in the\ncurrent rules. The last rules update was years ago when programs were much\nsmaller and transfer speeds much lower. The existing 0day rules did not address\nproblems of software encountered today, simply because at that date it did not\nexist. These changes have led to a series of loopholes which groups have been\ntaking advantage of. The new rules we constructed aim to close these loopholes,\nas well as increase the general quality level of releases in the scene.\n\nThis document covers a new ruleset for 0day. These rules and guidelines are\nintended for release-groups in the first place, and sites secondary. We hope\nthat in time many sites will take over the majority of these rules. The\nfollowing groups have signed and committed to following these rules:\n\nACME AiR AGAiN ALiAS ARN BACKLASH BEAN BLiZZARD BRD CORE CRD\nCROSSFiRE DIGERATI DVT EMBRACE FALLEN FAS iNViSiBLE LND\nMESMERiZE NGEN NULL ORiON OUTLAWS RiTUEL ROGUE\nSHOCK SSG TBE UNLEASHED VACE ZWT\n\nThese rules will go into effect starting January 31st, 2010.\n\n* Release Name\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n[.].v[.][.][.]\n[.][.]-\n\nDeveloper.Name is only mandatory if the application name is not unique enough\nfor duping. Groups should use some common sense to keep the directory name\nreasonable length.\n\nThe program name should be the &quot;official&quot; name of the application. Do not omit\ndashes, think of your dupe results.\n\nThe Language tag must be used only on NON english releases. Multilingual and\nbilingual are optional.\n\nCurrently valid OS tags are:\n- Win98, WinME, WinNT, Win2k, WinXP, Win2k3, Vista, Win2k8, Win7\n(can have an optional tag for more specific edition)\n- [Distribution.]Linux\n- MacOSX\n- [Free|Net|Open]BSD\n- [Open]Solaris\n- AIX\n- HPUX\n- Open.Enterprise.Server (NetWare)\n\nThe Operating.System tag should be omitted when WinAll (= NT5 based windows\nand optionally earlier, always with latest official service pack). Using a\nUnixAll (= all of the operating systems above, excluding Windows, Linux or\nMacOSX) or a WinAll tag means your app *must* run on *all* of the operating\nsystems that fall under it.\n\nCPU should be omitted when x86, must be x64 for x86_64/EM64T, but not IA64!\nCurrently valid CPU tags are:\n- x86, x64, IA64, PPC, SPARC, SPARC64, RISC, Alpha\n\nRelease.Type can be omitted for Crack/Regged, but is mandatory for keygen\nreleases. Possible tags are:\n- Keygen.Only Keymaker.Only\n- Incl.Keygen Incl.Keymaker\n- Incl.Keygen.and.Patch Incl.Keymaker.and.Patch\n- Cracked\n- Regged\n\nAdditional.Tags like READ.NFO, DIRFIX, NFOFIX.. must go as follows:\n- DevelopersName.ProgramName.v1.2.Regged.READ.NFO-GROUP\n- DevelopersName.ProgramName.v1.2.Regged.DIRFIX-GROUP\n\nYou can use underscores or dots as seperator in the releasename, but do not mix\nthem if there is no reason for it (e.g. a program name contains underscores and\nyour seperator is a dot is a valid reason to mix)\n\nThe lists in this section are by no means complete. They are here to serve as a\nguideline for proper dirname construction.\n\n* Packaging:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFilenames must be named up to a maximum of 8.3 characters (filename/extension).\n\nAcceptable compression format at this time is any compression method that\nsupports multiple volumes and long file names, followed by the traditional\nPKZIPing. Compressions other than RAR should include an extract utility or be a\nself-extracting archive.\n\nThe traditional packaging methods (zip/diz) shall be maintained, with a diz\nfile being present in each zip. The diz file should contain as a bare minimum\nthe number of the current disk and the maximum number of disks.\n\nSuggested file_id.diz layout is as follows:\n[xx/??], where ?? is the total nr of disks in the release. The total number\nof lines of your diz should not exceed 30.\n\nOn a side note: using ridiculous compressions that will save 10 disks but takes\n10 hours to unpack are not an acceptable solution.\n\n* Release Size:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAllowed split volume sizes are:\n- 1,444,000 bytes\n- 2,888,000 bytes\n- 5,000,000 bytes\n- 10,000,000 bytes\n- 50,000,000 bytes\n\nThe utils disk limit is as of now 70 x 5,000,000 bytes or 35 x 10,000,000 bytes.\nThis equates to a total of 350,000,000 bytes of compressed data. Oversize\nreleases are allowed when no ISO release exists and the group (or an iso group\nthey work with) is not in possession of the iso to release. In other words,\nthere is NO size limit for 0day apps, except when an iso exists!\n\nThe games disk limit is as of now 80 x 5,000,000 bytes or 40 x 10,000,000 bytes.\nThis equates to a total of 400,000,000 bytes of compressed data.\n\nAny release should have less than 100 volumes. In case 10,000,000 bytes do not\nsuffice, you are allowed to use volumes of larger size; up to 50,000,000 bytes.\n\nA size proper is valid when a group manages to reduce the size of the original\nrelease by at least 30% without sacrificing essential content:\n\n- Documentation, help files, and other non functional items can be ripped from\na release to decrease size. No functional parts of an application may be\nripped.\n- C++ redistributables, .NET framework, and other common operating system\ncomponents may be ripped. The nfo should note what has been ripped and\noptionally include an url where it can be downloaded.\n- A documentation addon is only allowed if the documentation cannot be\ndownloaded freely and publicly (without registration) from the developer's\nwebsite.\n\n* Specific Release Type:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAll of these releases should provide functionality identical to that of a fully\nlicensed copy.\n\n- Cracked: The program file has been altered to register the program. Any\nnags/trial limitations should be removed. Any remnants of &quot;Trial&quot; in the app\nneed to be removed. Any &quot;phone-home&quot; checks should be disabled!\n\n- Regged: Any way to make an application &quot;registered&quot; without requiring\nmodification of any of the applications executables/libraries. Must include\na text file with the required information, serials should not be put in the\nrelease nfo. Please name this file carefully, as to deter possible\nwebspiders looking for serial information.\n\n- Keygen: A small standalone program which generates valid serials/keyfiles\nwhich are based on user input or hardware id.\n\nKeygens can be written in any language but they should be native executables\nfor the OS the application is meant for: Linux keygens for Linux applications,\nMac keygens for Mac applications, etc. This means that if you do not follow\nthis suggestion, you could get propered. However, you won't be nuked if there\nis no native keygen available.\n\nA keygen that generates a system-dependant serial must explicitly warn the\nuser of this fact, either in the nfo OR at runtime.\n\nWindows keygens in java are allowed if the the program is coded in java or\nuses java. Same with any other interpreter language. If a library is included\nwith the latest windows install, as is the case for VB6/.NET/VBScript\ncurrently, then keygens written in these languages are allowed without\nquestion. The motivation here is that a scene release should run on a clean\nOS install, introducing no additional dependencies other than those imposed\nby the application being released.\n\nA console-based application that usually runs on headless systems (servers,\netc) requires a console-based keygen.\n\nGeneric Keygens (All.Products) are allowed and dupe full releases for as long\nas the generic keygen continues to work for *every* application it was\nintended for.\n\nKeygen.Only releases are releases that only contain the actual keygen, no\ninstallation files. They are meant as an addition to previous Crack/Regged\nreleases.\n\nA Keygen.and.Patch release combines a keygen with a crack to enable full\nfunctionality. You are still allowed to release a keygen.only for these\nreleases.\n\n- Retail: A store-bought supply is included in this release. You are allowed to\nrelease a retail after a previous release if there is an added benefit to\nusing the retail version. In this case you are required to add a READ.NFO tag\nto your dirname and list the benefits when compared to the previous release.\n\n- PROPER/WORKING: a proper of a previous scene-release that was not fully\nworking should always include adequate proof and information for nukers to\ntest and confirm the validity of the proper. This means including screenshots,\npieces of code, or clear steps to reproduce the problems that occur with\nthe release you are propering.\n\n- READ.NFO: If you label a release READ.NFO, please have a clearly stated\nsection in your nfo on what the READ.NFO is all about, dont make people guess.\nIf you want people to read it for a certain reason, make sure they can.\n\n\n* Operating Systems:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf a developer has not mentioned default or minimum requirements for operating\nsystem, the default is Windows XP, which is also a minimum.\n\nIf a program supports Windows Operating Systems before WinXP, then your crack\n*should* work on them aswell.\n\nOptional: combine multiple operating system versions for the same CPU in 1\nrelease if it remains within size limits, for example:\n- FreeBSD5,6,7 x86 can be in a single release tagged FreeBSD\nIf the installers are freely downloadable (available without registration) and\nthe same keygen/crack works for every version, consider only including the\nlatest version of the OS.\n\nPlease keep in mind that the contents of .tar.gz, .rpm, .deb and any other\npackaging system are generally identical. Please make a note in your nfo in\ncase of exceptions.\n\n* Minor Updates:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMU stands for Minor Update. This term denotes an update of a previously\nreleased application within a certain time-period, the MU-period. Major updates\nare allowed regardless of the last time a previous version was released. In\nthis case, the nfo should include some motivation for considering this a major\nupdate (security- and stability-critical hotfixes for instance)\n\nMU-period of 1 month, disregarding the number of days in a month. Examples:\n\n- a release on 2010-01-01 will be out of mu on 2010-02-01\n- a release on 2010-01-15 will be out of mu on 2010-02-15\n- a release on 2010-01-29 will be out of mu on 2010-02-28\n- a release on 2010-01-31 will be out of mu on 2010-02-28\n- a release on 2010-02-28 will be out of mu on 2010-03-28\n- a release on 2010-03-31 will be out of mu on 2010-04-30\n\nThis ensures no more than a single release of the same application per month,\nwhile keeping duping simple.\n\nThe minor update period is counted from the last valid release which contained\nthe software itself. In other words, keymaker.only releases are not considered.\n\n* General Rules:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- If the age of the last modified file of an installed program is older than\none (1) year it is not allowed to pre it without a READ.NFO or INTERNAL tag.\n\n- A group should release the newest version of the software available.\n\nExceptions are possible when the software is not available publicly, or if\nit was never released before, which *must* be mentioned in the nfo-file.\nThis means you can release an older version of an application, but *only* if\nit is newer than any existing release of the same app, and you have a valid\nreason for not releasing the latest version (for instance, it is very hard\nto get the supply, or the application takes months to crack).\n\nThere is a grace-period of 3 days: if a new version came out in the last 3\ndays before your release, you will not get nuked if you release the older\none.\n\n- Releases should provide the same functionality as a retail copy of the\napplication (where possible and reasonable). Examples:\n- a virus scanner must be able to update\n- a flexlm application should include every useful feature\n- a keygen should provide either all, or the best license (watermarks are\nstill allowed)\n\n- Your nfo should provide a minimum of useful information, including:\n- (complete) application name\n- (complete) version, including if it is a beta version\n- the release date\n- type of crack included\n- short description of the application/game\n- description on how to use the crack (important!)\n- operating systems this release will work on\n- pre-requisites for the application/game\n- url to the application's website\n\n- If you do not want your work to be used by other groups (be it documents,\ncracking methods, tools, or similar), then make sure you don't give it out\nto anyone you can't trust. It is deemed public property as soon as it is\npublicly available, and you lose any exclusive rights to it.\n\n- Stealing cracks/keygens from P2P, WEB, or other scene groups is clearly not\nallowed!\n\n- Security should be everyone's primary concern. Including nicknames or\nidentities of people that have not given explicit permission in your nfo's\nis absolutely not allowed, and may result in severe repercussions.\n\nA big thanks to everyone involved in creating this document!\n\nLast modified: 10 January 2010\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:470b35b06afa75cd98e59749408ee1927e9a94a4","amp;dn":"%2A+%2A+Zeroday+Scene+Rules+v2010+%2A+%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"470b35b06afa75cd98e59749408ee1927e9a94a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,11,53,176,106,250,117,205,152,229,151,73,64,142,225,146,126,154,148,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
