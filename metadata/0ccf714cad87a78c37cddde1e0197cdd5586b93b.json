Other new features include a multiplayer mode,\nin which as many as 16 players can compete on the same computer.\n\nIn the new version, the realistic gameplay has been developed even further, \nwith each jump recreated using data provided by the International Ski Federation, \nthe FIS. Other authentic features include a scoring system where points are \nawarded for body position and landing, as well as a range of management and \ntraining options. One of the most intriguing dimensions of the game is the \nability to hire a trainer and choose your own ski equipment in a bid to \nimprove your performance over the season. After developing your ability in \ntraining and competition, you can even save your jumper on diskette and pit \nyour skills against friends.\n\n\nExtract Archive With Winrar Or 7zip etc.........\n\nThen Mount Image Or Burn To CD\n\nInstall The Game Then Copy Crack Content To Install Directory\nOverwriting Original ski2001.exe\n\n\nENJOY AND PLEASE SEED\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ccf714cad87a78c37cddde1e0197cdd5586b93b","amp;dn":"Skijump.Challenge.2001.PC.Game%28djDEVASTATE%C3%A2%E2%80%9E%C2%A2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ccf714cad87a78c37cddde1e0197cdd5586b93b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,207,113,76,173,135,167,140,55,205,221,225,224,25,124,221,85,134,185,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
