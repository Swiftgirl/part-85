Andy is confident he will soon find something, but as \n       the months pass, the strain starts to show on both adults and \n       children, including their 8-year-old daughter Hannah.\n       \n       In the North East of England, 9-year-old Leah sums up the world as \n       she see it; &quot;I don't really understand why there isn't that much \n       money anymore, I only really understand that people are all losing \n       their jobs. Is that the recession?&quot; As the pressures of \n       unemployment take their toll on her parents's relationship, and her \n       dad's temper, Leah observes &quot;If I'm naughty then he gets more angry \n       with me that he usually would. But he's trying to keep himself \n       calm, and I think he's doing well. I just hope he gets a job.&quot;\n       \n       And in Enfield, Samantha, also nine, is missing her dad. Both her \n       parents lost their jobs of 20+ years when the car parts company \n       they worked for, originally part of Ford, filed for bankruptcy. But \n       rather than meekly walking away, Samantha's dad, along with several \n       hundred others, occupied the plant, demanding that Ford honour \n       their original severance terms.\n       \n       This gently-observed documentary takes us inside the experience of \n       losing the thing most of us use to define ourselves.\n\n\n                             Big up all scene massive!\n\n\n    \n                                       \n                GROUP  INFORMATION          \n         9 Years of the Force and still    \n                      going strong                  \n     \n\n           What we are looking for:\n\n           * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n           * Fios x264 rippers or cappers\n           * also we have a contest to annouce we are in need of a\n           * new nfo ascii artwork design email us with your designs\n           * winners artwork will be added as our new nfo\n           * dont forget to tag your work\n           * If you think you can help contact us on irc\n           * or email us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;591f362b3a3c19312c2a31773830&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd657e16a7bea0dccb088189f6ec7cde18204d47","amp;dn":"Jobless.2010.DOCU.WS.PDTV.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd657e16a7bea0dccb088189f6ec7cde18204d47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,101,126,22,167,190,160,220,203,8,129,137,246,236,124,222,24,32,77,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
