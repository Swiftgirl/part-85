Reason, the spirit of philosophy, concerns\nitself only with itself, and troubles itself over no Object. God,\nto the philosopher, is as neutral as a stone ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the philosopher is a\ndedicated atheist. If he busies himself with God, there is no reverence\nhere, only rejection, for he seeks only that reason which has\nconcealed itself in every form, and that only in the light of reason.\nReason only seeks itself, only troubles itself about itself, loves only\nitself ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ or rather, since it is not even an Object to itself ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ does\nnot love itself but simply is with itself.
