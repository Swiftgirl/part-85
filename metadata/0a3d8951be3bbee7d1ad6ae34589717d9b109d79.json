The show premiered February 15, 2009, at 10:30 p.m. On April 8, 2009, HBO announced it had renewed the series for a second season.\n\n\nEpisode 4 - &quot;Chapter 4&quot; - Stevie puts together a DVD of Kenny's greatest moments in the hopes that the major leagues will notice. Later, Kenny attends a BBQ with his &quot;fuck buddy&quot; Tracy at April and Terrence's house where his romantic feelings for April intensify, and she shows the first signs of reciprocation, but an awkward moment gives them pause. Tracy gets Terrence, April's fiance (and Kenny's current boss), drunk, and he calls Kenny out for being a has-been in front of Stevie, April, Tracy, and all of their friends. Features the song &quot;Fuck'd up&quot; by Memphis rapper Lil Wyte. \n\nLooks like this is the only 720p version of this show so ENJOY!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a3d8951be3bbee7d1ad6ae34589717d9b109d79","amp;dn":"Eastbound.and.Down.S01E04.720p-%5Bmak621%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a3d8951be3bbee7d1ad6ae34589717d9b109d79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,61,137,81,190,59,190,231,209,173,106,227,69,137,113,125,155,16,157,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
