This torrent contains THE FULL LENGTH VIDEO in MP4 format, ripped for MOBILE DEVICES.\n\n2. THIS IS NOT A HQ FULLSCREEN VID FOR COMPUTERS!!!!!! It has been COMPRESSED for viewing on SMALL screens.\n\n3. I have only tested this rip on 2 mobile devices (both support MP4/aac), SAMSUNG &amp; iphone.\n\n4. As far as I can tell, it should also be compatable with most mobile devices like PSP, ipod, and most cells\nthat have MP4 capabilities, and after looking online, MOST newer cell phones will play these files with no problems\nand they use minimal space compared to other formats, like .3GP, ALSO  T-MOBILE SIDEKICK (LX) and BLACKBERRY COMPATIBLE!\n\n5. I AM NOT YOUR TECH. Learn your device capabilities before you DL.\n\n6. DO NOT ASK ME HOW TO's. The only advice I can offer, is the only way I've tried, which is:\n\n download file to computer\n\n open explorer\n\n plug in mobile device to computer\n\n drag and drop file from computer folder to device (SD or memory card may be required for file space 1-2 Gb recommended for\nmultiple files.) Each file can be between 140-250 megs depending on length, and resolution bitrate.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: if you are using this for PSP, GOOGLE how to install, (unless you already know installation), \nbecause I did see online there is a sepecific way to do it, but the file (MP4) is compatable.\n\nHere are the codecs...\n\nVideo codec: MP4v (H.264)\n\nVideo bitrate: 128 \n\nResolution: 320x240 &lt;--MOST phones use this resolution SOME support larger, like iphone\n\nframe rate: 20 fps\n\naudio codec: MP4a\n\nchannels: stereo\n\nsample rate 22050hz\n\naac ext.: SBR\n\nfile size: 161mb (compressed from 701mb)\n\n\n\nSCREENSHOTS are using VLC MEDIA PLAYER (REDUCED) to show the *ACTUAL APROXAMATE SIZE* of how it would look on a mobile device\nThe torrent name is listed to show it is the actual file, and not a fake.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i183.photobucket.com/albums/x225/jonnoel1/tr1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i183.photobucket.com/albums/x225/jonnoel1/tr1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i183.photobucket.com/albums/x225/jonnoel1/tr2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i183.photobucket.com/albums/x225/jonnoel1/tr2.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i183.photobucket.com/albums/x225/jonnoel1/tr3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i183.photobucket.com/albums/x225/jonnoel1/tr3.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nOne more shot of the actual MP4 playing on my Samsung phone\n (the file name is on the top of the screen, and the controls fade when its un-paused)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i183.photobucket.com/albums/x225/jonnoel1/Photo0025.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i183.photobucket.com/albums/x225/jonnoel1/Photo0025.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThis is a shot of AVATAR, a clearer pic so you can see the quality and size better,\nsorry about the blurry pics.... &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i183.photobucket.com/albums/x225/jonnoel1/avatarmobile.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i183.photobucket.com/albums/x225/jonnoel1/avatarmobile.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nJust keep in mind, I did make this for mobile devices to SAVE SPACE, so the QUALITY is not at a high bitrate. HOWEVER I did also test\nother files at a higher bitrate of 192, (which increased the file size approx. 100 megs), and it looks a LOT cleaner on my phone.\n\n(Check my torrents for: 192 bitrate vid rips (about 250 megs or so) for mobiles, its the Hi-res I tested for quality)\n\nI WANT INPUT from people who use these to see which types you prefer, the smaller-low res space savers, or the high-res bigger files. \n\nA 2Gb mini SD card can hold around 6-7 low res movies, or 3-4 High-res movies. I am just looking for input for future uploads, so all\nfeedback, and constructive criticism is welcome. Thanks for checking the movies out, and I hope they work out ok for you! \n\n\n\nIf you Download this torrent, feel free to comment and let me know if it works on your device, TECH TIPS WELCOME\nso others can DL it to use on theirs as well (or not...lol). and PLEASE DONT FORGET TO SEED THIS TORRENT! Its a small file\n so it shouldnt take long to seed it out so PLEASE give back to the community and SEED! Thanks, and of course, ENJOY!\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08d476c6817c1565f39cc0c378bb215106f5dee0","amp;dn":"Terminator+Salvation_MOBILE+DEVICES_psp.cell+phone.ipod_jonnoel1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08d476c6817c1565f39cc0c378bb215106f5dee0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,212,118,198,129,124,21,101,243,156,192,195,120,187,33,81,6,245,222,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
