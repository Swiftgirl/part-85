I created this disk myself from an untouched\nOEM disk using RyanVM Integrator, Nlite, Driver Pack Finisher and a few other apps. This is the culmination of months of\nresearch and experimentation. This will certainly install on ANY system, but if you built your own system, you will need\nto provide your own license key or use the included activation crack, or else after 30 days you will be locked out. BURN THE ISO\nAT 4X SPEED! If your PC is a Dell, Sony, Gateway, etc. on the OEM list in the description of this torrent, Windows will\nactivate during installation and never ask you for a product key, and it will not only pass WGA, it will actually be\ngenuine. This is not a crack or generated key being used. The keys used are genuine SLP keys for the OEM activation of\nthese systems. The manufacturers use the same keys.\n\nVERSION 4.0\n\nHere is the OEM list. I was not able to test\nevery OEM.

I am especially anxious to know what OEMs it works\nor does not work on since I was unable to test it on all of them. Any other questions, please ask. Enjoy!
