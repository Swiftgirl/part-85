Known as Dark Matter and Dark Energy, these opposing forces have the capacity to rip apart the universe atom-by-atom. \n\nWhile scientists have previously theorised about a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBig CrunchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ where the universe retracts back to its original size, the discovery of Dark Matter and Dark Energy has placed that hypothesis on the backburner. Some astronomers now believe that if Dark Matter offsets Dark Energy then as the universe slowly expands, stars will gradually fade, running out of fuel and leading to a dark, cold and lifeless universe. \n\nOthers hypothesise a much more violent end where Dark Energy continues to expand the universe at a greater and greater speed. Stronger than gravity, Dark Energy would pull apart everything down to the fundamental particles ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the universeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s very fibres. While the universeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s end may be 50 billion years away, great leaps in science will continue to alter how we believe the universe was formed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and how it will end.\n\n\n\nVideo Codec: XviD 1.0.3\nVideo Bitrate: 2053 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 688x432\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.593:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 128kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 47:24.840\nPart Size: 742MB\nSubtitles: tvcap , NO\nRipped by: jvt40\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a709369bc460e9c62898d847d5cb556977790753","amp;dn":"National+Geographic+-+Death+of+the+Universe+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a709369bc460e9c62898d847d5cb556977790753","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,9,54,155,196,96,233,198,40,152,216,71,213,203,85,105,119,121,7,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
