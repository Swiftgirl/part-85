Nathan Frost is just a regular grunt in an international army called the Liberty Coalition. When he takes massive injuries from an explosion on the battlefield, Frost undergoes an experimental procedure. The outcome of the surgery is something more than human; a transformation that makes him a unique weapons-grade warrior, with abilities that far surpass those of the average soldier.\n\nEmpowered with these extra-normal abilities via implanted augmentations, Frost is immediately sent to the frontlines of a war as a secret weapon against the destructive regime. Stranded in hostile territory, cut off from command and far outnumbered, Frost and a handful of men must try and stop the entire renegade militia's plan threatening to plunge the world into darkness.\n\n* Engage in battle online multiplayer with up to 16 players &amp; voice over IP support in classic and new multiplayer modes. \n\n* A wide variety of game pacing ranges from the frenetic chaos of battlefield action to tactical stealth infiltration style missions. \n\n* Equip yourself with an arsenal of experimental weaponry such as the Riot WallÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ and Attack Drones, and other high tech gadgetry. Used in combination, the equipment yields a variety and depth of gameplay never before realized, especially in multiplayer play. \n\n* In multiplayer, vehicles are co-operatively used; one guy drives while the other mans the mounted turrets. \n\n* Augmentations such as Invisibility, Reflex Boost and Electrical Storm give you an edge on the battlefield against your highly equipped and battle-ready foe. \n\n* Pick-up &amp; play, visceral action pulls the player through a cinematically immersive storyline from Minute One of play. \n\n* 11 missions spanning across 16 maps including the Opera House turned Prison, a Buddhist Temple converted to a Military Base, and the sprawling urban Wastelands.\n\n---------------------------\nSystem Requirements\n\nMinimum:\nIBM PC or 100% compatible, Microsoft Windows 2000/XP, Pentium IV, 1.5 GHz (Or AMD Athlon XP equivalent) processor, 100% DirectX 64 MB 3D Accelerated video card with Pixel Shader v1.1 Capability, 256 MB System RAM, 100% DirectX 9 Compatible Sound Card, 3GB free uncompressed hard drive space (additional space may be necessary for saved games), 100% Windows 2000/XP compatible Mouse and Keyboard\n\nRecommended:\nPentium IV, 2.4 Ghz (or AMD Athlon XPequivalent) or greater processor, 512 MB System RAM, 100% DirectX 9 128MB 3D Graphics Card with Pixel Shader 2.0 support, 3GB of Hard Drive Space\n\nSupported Video Chipsets:\nnVidia GeForce 3Ti/4Ti/FX/6000 series - Note: GeForce MX series is NOT SUPPORTED.
