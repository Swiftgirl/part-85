In Toshio MatsumotoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s controversial debut feature, seemingly nothing is taboo: neither the incorporation of visual flourishes straight from the worlds of contemporary graphic-design, painting, comic-books, and animation; nor the unflinching depiction of nudity, sex, drug-use, and public-toilets. But of all the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtransgressionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ here on display, perhaps one in particular stands out the most: the filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s groundbreaking and unapologetic portrayal of Japanese gay subculture.\n\nCross-dressing club-kid Eddie (played by real-life transvestite entertainer extraordinaire Peter, famed for his role as Kyoami the Fool in Akira KurosawaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Ran) vies with a rival drag-queen (Osamu Ogasawara) for the favours of drug-dealing cabaret-manager Gonda (Yoshio Tsuchiya, himself a Kurosawa player who appeared in such films as Seven Samurai, Throne of Blood, and High and Low). Passions escalate and blood begins to flow ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ before all tensions are released in a jolting climax that prefigures by nearly thirty years Tsai Ming-liangÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s similarly scandalous The River.\n\nWith its mixture of purely narrative sequences and documentary footage, Funeral Parade of Roses comes to us from a moment when cinema set itself to test, and even eradicate, the boundaries between fiction and reality, desire and experience; consequently, the film shares a kinship with such other 1969 works as Masahiro ShinodaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Double Suicide and Ingmar BergmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s A Passion [The Passion of Anna]. Yet Matsumoto achieves a zig-zag modulation between pathos and hilarity that makes his picture utterly unique: a filmic howl in the face of social, moral, and artistic convention. The Masters of Cinema Series is proud to present Toshio MatsumotoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Funeral Parade of Roses for the first time outside of Japan on any home video format.\n\nMOVIE:\nORIGINAL TITLE: Bara no sÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´retsu\nDIRECTOR: Toshio Matsumoto\nCOUNTRY: Japan\nYEAR: 1969\n\nDVD:\nDVD RELEASE: 21 Aug 2006\nSTUDIO: Eureka Entertainment (Masters of Cinema Series)\nCATALOG: EKA40226\nSYSTEM: NTSC\nCOLOR: Grayscale\nSCREEN: 1.33:1\nAUDIO: Japanese Dolby Digital 1.0\nSUBTITLES: English Subtitles\nRUNTIME (MOVIE): 105 minutes\n\nEXTRACTION:\nENGINE: MacTheRipper 3.0 (R14m)\nDVD: 1 Full Dual-Layer DVDs\nFILE EXTENSION: .ISO (Image)\nDISC FILE SIZE: 4.81 GBs\nSCANS: Full Art Scan + Booklet\nART SCANS FORMAT: PDF (FROM 600DPI Original)\nBOOKLET FORMAT: PDF (FROM 600DPI Original)\nSCANS FILE SIZE: 13.5 MBs\nTOTAL FILE SIZE: 4.82 GBs\n*Sizes in decimal format\n\nDISC FEATURES:\n- New transfer from the directorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s personal print\n- Full length audio commentary by the director Toshio MATSUMOTO\n- Video interview with director Toshio MATSUMOTO (23 minutes)\n- Promotional material gallery\n- Original trailer\n- New and improved optional English subtitles\n- 40-page booklet featuring a new essay by Jim OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Rourke\n\nINFO LINKS: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funeral_Parade_of_Roses&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funeral_Parade_of_Roses&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://eurekavideo.co.uk/moc/catalogue/funeral-parade-of-roses/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://eurekavideo.co.uk/moc/catalogue/funeral-parade-of-roses/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nABOUT THIS TORRENT:\n- Please enable DHT AND PEX\n- Download at will, but please be a good leech and help seed if you can!\n\n\nAll my releases are scanned/ripped by myself.\nGET A LIFE COPYCAT-LAMERS!
