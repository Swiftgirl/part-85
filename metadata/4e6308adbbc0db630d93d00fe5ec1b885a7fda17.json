What Really Happened is proud to be one of the oldest political blogs on the net.\nRivero runs the WhatReallyHappened radio show on GCN six days a week, and makes good use of his sharp wit to help his blog visitors and radio listeners not only to read/hear the news but to understand what IS really happening. \n\n===============================================================\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e6308adbbc0db630d93d00fe5ec1b885a7fda17","amp;dn":"What+Really+Happened+-+Feb+19+FR+%5Bsebaygo1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e6308adbbc0db630d93d00fe5ec1b885a7fda17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,99,8,173,187,192,219,99,13,147,208,15,229,236,27,136,90,127,218,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
