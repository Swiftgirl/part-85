And\nthough Josh Homme continues to be the highest profile ex-member of the seminal\ndesert rock group, the best Kyuss-related release of 2009 not only has nothing\nto do with that crooked vulture, but doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t even include anyone who was\nactually a member of the band! House of Broken Promises formed out of the ashes\nof John GarciaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Unida, with Eddie Plascencia doing double duty on bass and lead\nvocals. The eleven tracks on Using The Useless are sensational, sleazy, and\nfamiliar. Sure, House of Broken Promises arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t doing anything all that\ninnovative, but theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re doing it a hell of a lot better than Nickelback or\nDaughtry or just about any other purported ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhard rockÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ band out there right now.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlisterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is on par with anything off DownÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s last album, while ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHighway GritÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nmight as well be the unofficial theme song for Sons Of Anarchy. The chorus on\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTornÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is so damn catchy and anthemic that it almost seems unfair that youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re\nunlikely to ever hear it on the radio. HereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hoping the band tours in 2010 and\nraises their profile a bit more. Using The Useless is a fucking diamond in the\nrough.\n\n- Gary Suarez","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fe6ebdd75913cce38cb5ab5f642196424a15c50","amp;dn":"House_Of_Broken_Promises-Using_The_Useless-2009-SDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fe6ebdd75913cce38cb5ab5f642196424a15c50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,230,235,221,117,145,60,206,56,203,90,181,246,66,25,100,36,161,92,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
