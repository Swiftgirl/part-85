It was originally released (credited to Camp Kill Yourself) on February 27, 1999 by Teil Martin International/Distant Recordings and was limited to 2,500 copies.[1]  Later reissued by Volcom under various titles, the album spawned one single: &quot;96 Quite Bitter Beings&quot;.\n\n\nHistory\n\nVolume 1 was originally released (credited to Camp Kill Yourself) on February 27, 1999 by Teil Martin International and was limited to 2,500 copies.[1]  A second release on December 12, 1999 was limited to 1,000 copies, before the album was reissued by Volcom Entertainment when the band signed with them in 2000ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½first on April 1, under the title CKY and limited to 2,000 copies; then on May 1, under the title Camp and limited to 4,000 copies; and finally on October 1, under the title Camp Volume 1  and limited to a much larger 20,000.[1]  When CKY signed to Island Def Jam Music Group in 2001, they too reissued the album. Island/Def Jam's edition was an enhanced CD released with different coloured album coversÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½purple, blue, orange (all of which were limited to 5,000 copies each) and red (of which copies were unlimited). CKY's British distributor, Mercury Records, also issued Volume 1 in 2002, and a downloadable version of the record was made available in 2008.\n\n\nAlbum cover\n\nThe original album cover depicted Budd Dwyer as he famously shot himself on live television. When it was prepared for release by Volcom, the label's manager demanded the cover be changed, and that the band change their name to something less offensive (hence the switch from Camp Kill Yourself to CKY).[2] The next, more well-known, cover features a photograph of lead guitarist Chad I. Ginsburg performing his trademark 'bitch toss', in which he throws his guitar 360 degrees around his back and catches it when it returns. The photo was taken on the 1999 Warped Tour.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs written by Deron Miller, Chad I.
