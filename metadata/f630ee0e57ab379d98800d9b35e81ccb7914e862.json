For those whose only exposure to Craig and Charlie Reid is &quot;I'm \n\nGonna Be (500 Miles),&quot; this collection will surely demonstrate that the boys are \n\nNOT the one-hit-wonders the uninitiated believe them to be.\n\n\nThe bulk of this collection is contained on four CDs, which until now were \n\navailable only to fan club members: &quot;Another Side of the Story&quot; (2 discs) and &quot;The \n\nOther Sides of the Story&quot; (2 discs).  Also included is a concert performance \n\nrecorded in March 2008 at the Hotel Cafe in Hollywood, CA, and assorted odd bits \n\nI've collected over time.\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nPS - Please purchase the official releases of The Proclaimers' catalogue in order \n\nto support the creators of the music we love.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f630ee0e57ab379d98800d9b35e81ccb7914e862","amp;dn":"Proclaimers+Odds+%26+Ends","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f630ee0e57ab379d98800d9b35e81ccb7914e862","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,48,238,14,87,171,55,157,152,128,13,155,53,232,28,203,121,20,232,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
