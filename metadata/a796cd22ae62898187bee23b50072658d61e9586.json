When she arrives, she meets the strange Tankerton Slopes, who claims to come from a parallel version of London known as 'Undone'. Undone is &quot;where the weirdness comes from.&quot; Weird things flow into London and mundane things flow into Undone, making them the peculiar places they are.\n\nEdna and Tankerton soon become friends, partly because Tankerton is interested that her home town is pronounced the same way as the well-known kitchen appliance, and that they also have the same boss, Carlo Jones, all be it two different versions of him.\n\nTankerton offers Edna the task of finding anyone from Undone who is in London and bring them back, for if an Undoner stays in London for too long, things become very weird indeed.\n\nIn series one, Edna learns about Undone and becomes involed with trying to return Undoners back home. But when she encounters dishy Undoner Grant, she lets him stay with surreal consequences.\n\nIn series two, Tankerton plans to get married to Ida, a woman from the very boring version of London called Donlon. Edna meanwhile meets her real father, learns she has a half-sister, and tries to find a precious gem.\n\nIn series three, Get Out! has collapsed and reformed as an online newsletter called Go On!, with the help of Ida. Edna soon finds herself with more Undone business, involving the strange Golfer Mackenzie who meets up with every version of himself from every version of London.\n\nCast:\nSarah Solemani (Edna Turner - Series 1)\nAlex Tregear (Edna Turner - Series 2 and 3)\nBen Moor\nDuncan Wisbey\nKevin Eldon\nSophie Duval\nTim Key\nMontserrat Lombard\nEmma Kennedy\n\nWritten by Ben Moor\n\nEpisode Guide &gt; http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/undone/episodes/\n\nUndone - S01 - E00 - Mind The Gaps \n\nUndone - S01 - E01 - Unappreciated \nUndone - S01 - E02 - Unrivalled \nUndone - S01 - E03 - Unfamiliar \nUndone - S01 - E04 - Unravelled \n\nUndone - S02 - E01 - Unaccompanied \nUndone - S02 - E02 - Unsurprised \nUndone - S02 - E03 - Unrelated \nUndone - S02 - E04 - Unaccustomed \nUndone - S02 - E05 - Unwelcome \nUndone - S02 - E06 - Unification \n\nUndone - S03 - E01 - Unalike \nUndone - S03 - E02 - Untoward \nUndone - S03 - E03 - Ungainly \nUndone - S03 - E04 - Underground \nUndone - S03 - E05 - United \nUndone - S03 - E06 - Unending\n\n\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration Approx : 28mn 00s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits\n\n\n[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a796cd22ae62898187bee23b50072658d61e9586","amp;dn":"Ben+Moor+-+Undone+-+Series+01+to+03+-+Audio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a796cd22ae62898187bee23b50072658d61e9586","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,150,205,34,174,98,137,129,135,190,226,59,80,7,38,88,214,30,149,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
