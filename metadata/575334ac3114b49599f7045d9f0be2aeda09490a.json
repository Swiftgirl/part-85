His girlfriend, Ann Morris is a singer who is also climbing to the top. Now it seems the syndicate wants Billy and Ann to join their &quot;management firm&quot;. But Billy knows that they will be treated like property, so he refuses and tells her to do the same. So they try to &quot;encourage&quot; him to join but he still refuses. He would be advised that they will not stop, so he must stop them, permanently. He is even more hesitant to do that but when an attempt on his life is made, he fakes his death and alters his appearance, and decides to go after the syndicate; taking them out one at a time.\n\n**EXTRAS AND TRAILERS REMOVED**\n**THIS IS MENU WITH FULL MOVIE**\n\nPlease leave feedback\nPlease help seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:575334ac3114b49599f7045d9f0be2aeda09490a","amp;dn":"Game+of+Death+%281972%2F1979%29+DVD-R+NTSC+ENG+%5Bwulfy1978%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"575334ac3114b49599f7045d9f0be2aeda09490a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,83,52,172,49,20,180,149,153,247,4,93,159,11,226,174,218,9,73,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
