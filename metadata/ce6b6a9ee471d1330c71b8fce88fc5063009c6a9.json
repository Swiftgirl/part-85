Despite the fact that things didn't end up going as planned, during the following years Meat Loaf ended up recording all but two of the songs from &quot;Bad For Good&quot; on various albums (including the eventual &quot;Bat Out Of Hell II&quot;).\n\nSo in an attempt to create the feel of the never realised &quot;Renegade Angel&quot;, I collected and arranged all of the &quot;Bad For Good&quot; songs that Meat Loaf recorded (as well as the 2 original Jim Steinman ones), created a new album cover (in which I gave Jim Steinman a higher billing) and uploaded it for you.\n\n----------------------\n\nATTENTION - THIS DOES NOT CONTAIN NEW RECORDINGS!\n\nHere is a list of the (Meat Loaf performed) songs and the albums on which they appear:\n\nBad For Good                                 Bat Out Of Hell 3\nOut Of The Frying Pan (&amp; Into The Fire)      Bat Out Of Hell 2\nLost Boys &amp; Golden Girls                     Bat Out Of Hell 2\nSurf's Up                                    Bad Attitude\nLeft In The Dark                             Welcome To The Neighborhood\nRock &amp; Roll Dreams Come Through              Bat Out Of Hell 2\n\n----------------------\n\nI'm keen to know what people think of the cover art, so don't be afraid to leave a comment.\n----------------------\n\nIf you plan on uploading this to another torrent site, please have the decency to acknowledge the fact that it isn't your creation. I've seen this posted on 3 other torrent sites by 3 different people who all claim this compilation as their own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce6b6a9ee471d1330c71b8fce88fc5063009c6a9","amp;dn":"Meat+Loaf+-+Renegade+Angel+%5B320kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce6b6a9ee471d1330c71b8fce88fc5063009c6a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,107,106,158,228,113,209,51,12,113,184,252,232,143,197,6,48,9,198,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
