If you havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t heard, Eric Massa, an upstate Democratic Congressman from New York, is accused of sexually harassing a male aide.  At a wedding a few months ago, a male aide joked to Massa that he (Massa) should be chasing after bridesmaids. From what happened next, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m guessing that comment was meant to be ironic. In MassaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own words ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI grabbed the staff member sitting next to me and said, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Well, what I really ought to be doing is fracking you.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ And then I tossled the guyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hair and left.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Yeesh. It would be less disturbing if he just used the real f-word and grabbed the guyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s crotch. And I hope he didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t use the word ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfrackingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ during the incident. WhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the point of that? Is this sexual harassment thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s trying for a PG rating? From MasaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own description, this is the most awkward sexual approach ever that didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t actually involve a rag soaked in chloroform. \n\nSo now Eric Massa is following up the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most awkward and absurd sexual incident with the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most awkward and absurd defense. He claims this is all part of a plot by the White House to get rid of him because he voted against the healthcare bill in the House. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll say thisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½if the White House dreamed up this scenario to destroy him, theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re geniuses, because when he described it, he sounded like a damned lunatic. This is like like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGaslight,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhatever Happened to Baby Jane,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHush Hush Sweet CharlotteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ all rolled into one. Massa said the White House ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwill stop at nothing to pass this health care bill. And now theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve gotten rid of me and it will pass. You connect the dots.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Well, if you want unrelated dots connected, the place to go is Glenn Beck. And thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s exactly where Massa is going, today.  Glenn Beck has never met two dots he couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t connectÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and then connect them to a progressive conspiracy that started with Teddy Roosevelt. It should be more fun than a boiling pot full of rubber frogs. I just hope these two guys can have a nice cry together.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5daaba9649c084587f48f193f885289b088055a1","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+March+09+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5daaba9649c084587f48f193f885289b088055a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,170,186,150,73,192,132,88,127,72,241,147,248,133,40,155,8,128,85,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
