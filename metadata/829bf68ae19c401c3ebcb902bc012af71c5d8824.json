Monster music. It is your soundtrack for the impending zombie apocalypse. \n\nMixing hardcore gabber beats and bass with more traditional percussion, industrial sounds, metal, rock and punk guitars with Scream Machine frontwoman SinDelle MorteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s alternately sexy and ripping vocals, Scream Machine is not your everyday mainstream industrial sound. According to SinDelle Morte, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA lot of the industrial and electronic music today sounds really over-processed and over-produced to us. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s industrial. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not pop. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s supposed to be hard and heavy and gritty and nasty-sounding. We want to kind of get away from that over-processed sound.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nScream Machine receives play on many web and land radio stations all over the world and in many bondage, fetish and S&amp;M nightclubs, as well as many fetish venues, including London Fetish Fair and SPANK! Festival.
