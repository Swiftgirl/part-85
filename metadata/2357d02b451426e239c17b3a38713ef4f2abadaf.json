Drug-resistance has mutated the virus into a ravaging psychological plague, rendering the 'the dying' desperate, paranoid and violent. Two survivors come together on an isolated farmhouse in desperate circumstances- April, a young mysterious girl with a dark past has survived alone for months, and Daniel, a man desperate and bereaved, clings desperately onto hope in the outside world. When a mysterious stranger turns up, they are confronted with a new enemy even deadlier than the one beyond the perimeter.\n\nRESOLUTION........: 624x288\nVIDEO.............: 1040kb/s @ 25fps\nAUDIO FORMAT......: MP3 @ 111Kb/s\nLANGUAGES.........: English\n\ncredit AVCDVD &amp; to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone\n\nUPLOAD DEDICATED TO redchaos2354, Motley Crue, jdpennington, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, xxxUniversalAbsurdityxxx &amp; many, many more &amp; to all the awesome people who are sharing (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY)***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE!!!\n\n*****help what we can with haiti or any other in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2357d02b451426e239c17b3a38713ef4f2abadaf","amp;dn":"The.Dead.Outside.2008.DVDRip.XviD-AVCDVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2357d02b451426e239c17b3a38713ef4f2abadaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,87,208,43,69,20,38,226,57,193,123,58,56,113,62,244,242,171,173,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
