With a narrative and often humorous style Snider's songs are laced with his observations on politics, religion and culture, alongside his own autobiographical experiences from a life of hard living and the odd brush with the law.\n\nBorn in Portland, Oregon, Todd Snider moved to California after leaving school and learned to play the harmonica. His brother, living in Austin, Texas, thought Todd might find a job in a band there so he sent him a plane ticket. After seeing original Texan Outlaw Jerry Jeff Walker play in a local bar, Snider decided that was what he wanted to do with his life.\n\nChampioned by singer-songwriters Jimmy Buffett and John Prine Snider has recorded on both their labels during a career which has seen him release twelve albums in the past fifteen years. His 2006 album 'The Devil you know' was his most successful album to date and led to appearances on 'The Tonight Show' with Jay Leno and 'Late Night with David Letterman' . His latest album 'The Excitement plan' takes on themes such as war, unsolved murders and baseball, and includes a duet with country music legend Loretta Lynn.\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nBig House ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Cold Outside\n  Big House, MCA \n\nSid King &amp; The Five Strings ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Let 'Er Roll\n   Rollin' The Rock, El Toro \n\nNanci Griffith  - Sing\n   The Loving Kind, Rounder \n\nPatty Griffin -  Little Fire\n   Downtown Church, EMI \n\nSteve Martin - Daddy Played The Banjo\n  The Crow, ROUNDER \n\nCarolina Chocolate Drops -  Your Baby Ain't Sweet Like Mine\n  Genuine Negro Jig, Nonesuch \n\nJames Hand - Don't Want Me Too\n  Shadow On The Ground, DECCA/ROUNDER\n \nMarty Robbins - El Paso\n  Columbia Country Classics Vol. 3, Columbia \n\nTodd Snider :\n             Slim Chance\n             Unorganised Crime\n             Don't Tempt Me\n   The Excitement Plan, Continental Song City \n\n\nWilly Clay Band ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Stay Down\n           Blue, Blackstone Records \n\n\n\nHope you enjoy \n\nPlease seed! \n\n\nThanks \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b5e08b4f3d90b2154ab1a474cee4981e2047f5c","amp;dn":"BBC+Radio+2+-+Bob+Harris+Country+-+Broadcast+14th+Jan+2010.MP2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b5e08b4f3d90b2154ab1a474cee4981e2047f5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,94,8,180,243,217,11,33,84,171,26,71,76,238,73,129,226,4,127,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
