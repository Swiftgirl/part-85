GREAT FANSUBS!\n\n= TROUBLESHOOTiNG\n\n== WiNDOWS (2000, XP, Vista &amp; NEWER)\n\n=== The sound won't play/plays inproperly\n=== Video is only black\n=== WMP gives me an error\n\nFor all those problems @up - I recommend installing K-Lite Codec Pack (Full or bigger one) from it's official website:\n&gt;&gt; http://www.codecguide.com/download_kl.htm\nIt ALWAYS helps. If not, please redownload torrent.\n\n== LiNUX (Ubuntu, Mandriva, etc.)\n\n=== Problems with sound\n=== Problems with video\n=== Video player gives an errors playing this\n\nI personally suggest you using MPlayer for watching videos (+ an GUI like KMPlayer or gMPlayer) with latest gstreamer (install plugins from an bad, ugly etc.!) + ffmpeg (on the internet you can find PERFECT guides how to compile it yourself with most plugins) + x264. All you can download from your distro's repos.\n\n== OS X\n\nProblems never found\n\n= FAQ\n\n== WHY DiDN'T YOU COMPRESS YOUR TORRENTS?\n\nI compress it, but not everything. I didn't compress videos, music and/or images because I'm always optimizing it as much as I can without loss of quality. Compression gives an small loss of size for those.\n\n== WHERE i CAN FiND MORE YOUR TORRETS?\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/eXine/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/eXine/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n== iS DOWNLOADING ANiME LEGAL?\n\nIf in your country this anime wasn't released on DVD/Blu-Ray/aired - YES!\n\n== DO YOU TAKE RESPONSiBiLiTY OF iLLEGAL DOWNLOAD OF THiS ANiME?\n\nNo. But I can claim that any anime I'm uploading isn't released in my country. If it's released in your country - don't download it, go to shop and *BUY* it. Doing so you support Japanese culture, animation studios and author - and this is best way to say &quot;thank you&quot; for this anime!\n\n== WHY DON'T YOU HAVE x ON THEPiRATEBAY?\n\nThe reasons are often:\n- this anime is licensed in my coountry,\n- this anime isn't good IMO,\n- I found only LQ rips of this anime.\nRemember that I won't upload too popular ones. If you have them DIY - I won't help you.\n\n\n= N'JOY MY TORRENT!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec1095b95c9521e0810bda8e6351554bad50dcfa","amp;dn":"Hayate+no+Gotoku%21%21+%2F+Hayate+the+Combat+Butler%21%21+2nd+season+%2B+OVA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec1095b95c9521e0810bda8e6351554bad50dcfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,16,149,185,92,149,33,224,129,11,218,142,99,81,85,75,173,80,220,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
