A number of the tracks are beautiful arrangements, and the Grieg on here is indeed worthy of being fairly well-known already.  That being said, it is not one of my favourite CDs, but I am uploading this as I have not yet uploaded anything else of this style (being the main reason I have decided to break my resolve not to upload anything else from the Hyperion label - music from the c20 repetoire is their forte - and its ALL available for purchase, cheaply, in DRM-free MP3 and FLAC !).\n\nEAC / OGG aoTuV b5d q6\n\n__\n\n\nAt Twilight: Choral Music by Granger and Grieg (Hyperion Helios)\n\nPolyphony\nStephen Layton (cond)\n\n1.
