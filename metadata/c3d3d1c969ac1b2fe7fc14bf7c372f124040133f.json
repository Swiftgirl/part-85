File format is ISO to be burned on a DVD and played using a common DVD player.\n\nKin-Dza-Dza is something like an &quot;advanced cyberpunk film&quot;. It's a lot about people and social structures which on &quot;Plyuk&quot; of course have many parallels to our society. It's a very funny movie, but it's also a melancholic movie with great philosophical sense.\n\nSummary written by Anonymous\n\nDirected by \nGeorgi Daneliya \n\nWriting credits (in alphabetical order) \nGeorgi Daneliya \nRevaz Gabriadze \n\nCast (in credits order) \nStanislav Lyubshin ....
