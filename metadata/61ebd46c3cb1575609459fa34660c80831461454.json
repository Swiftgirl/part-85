In The Face Of Anger\n2. Faithless\n3. To No Avail\n4. The Usurper\n\nRadio anthems, ballads, epics, this EP has it all compacted into 4 ass-kicking tracks. The award winning In The Face of Anger EP brought the New England based band recognition form all parts of the globe. \n\n&quot;Certainly the opening cut, &quot;In The Face Of Anger&quot;, will leave you breathless with it's huge stomp riffs and gang chants. But beyond that comes a dramatic sense of melody and understanding. The clean vocals are the perfect addition, almost playing the part of the calm eye in the hurricane. Next track, &quot;Faithless&quot;, is easily one of the best songs of the year. The hook here is the fantastic piano sound, mixed in with amazing clean pop singing that moves into a more aggressive stance through the chorus parts.&quot;\n\n- MaximumMetal.com\n\nAlbum Credits\n\nProduced, Mixed, and Mastered by Ron Zabrocki\nAll songs written and performed by Shattersphere\nRecorded at Zabrocki Digital\nAlbum artwork by Shawn McCauley","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61ebd46c3cb1575609459fa34660c80831461454","amp;dn":"Shattersphere+-+In+The+Face+Of+Anger+%5B2005%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61ebd46c3cb1575609459fa34660c80831461454","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,235,212,108,60,177,87,86,9,69,159,163,70,96,200,8,49,70,20,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
