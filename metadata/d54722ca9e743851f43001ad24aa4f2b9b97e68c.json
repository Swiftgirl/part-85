Most people (just like me when \n         I started) don't know how to do this. It simply means that when \n      the download is complete, don't press stop or close down your program. \n      It will then be available to anyone who wants to download it from you.      Thanks.\n\n\n       Data is one of the most valuable assets that companies own today.\n\n        These assets are increasingly vulnerable as mobile computing has\n       become ever more widespread: sensitive information is often stored\n            on notebooks and removable media ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ without any firewall\n                                  protection.\n\n        Mobile devices and media, along with the sensitive and valuable\n       information that is stored on them, are especially at risk of loss\n        or theft. A companyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s management team is responsible for taking\n         all the appropriate steps to protect the organizationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s data.\n\n       SafeGuard Easy provides this protection: No unauthorized user may\n         access the device and read data or use the device as a tool to\n         enter the company network. If a device gets into unauthorised\n         hands, the data is securely protected even if the hard disk is\n        removed. Complete encryption of the entire hard disk and a user\n         authentication procedure that runs before the operating system\n                        boots provide secure protection.\n\n           Whether a single laptop or 10,000 PCs are to be protected,\n        SafeGuard Easy allows easy implementation and enforcement of the\n         IT security policy. With more than 3 million licences sold and\n        certified according Common Criteria EAL 3, SafeGuard Easy is the\n               market leader for hard disk encryption world-wide.\n\n        SafeGuard Easy is truly user proof. It operates transparently in\n       the background, so end users donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t need training or to change how\n           they work. For security officers, IT managers, and system\n        administrators, SafeGuard Easy offers transparent security, easy\n             security policy implementation, and simple deployment.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d54722ca9e743851f43001ad24aa4f2b9b97e68c","amp;dn":"SafeGuard+Easy+4.50.3.19","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d54722ca9e743851f43001ad24aa4f2b9b97e68c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,71,34,202,158,116,56,81,244,48,1,173,36,170,79,43,155,151,230,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
