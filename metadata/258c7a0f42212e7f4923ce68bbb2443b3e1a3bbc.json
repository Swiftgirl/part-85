He grew up a devout Muslim in a devout Muslim family \nin Ohio, USA. He wore his Muslim attire to school and kept a prayer rug in his locker. \nHe was proud of his religion. Caner notes, &quot;Every Muslim child learns about the scales. \nThe scales are terrifying. The Koran says if your scales are heavy, you will live \nin paradise; but if your scales are light, you will find perdition. You have to \nbe 51% righteous to get to paradise.&quot; The balance scales compare the good deeds \nto the bad deeds. So, Caner lived by the 5 pillars of Islam.\n\n&quot;But, there was this one kid...an obnoxious, wouldn't-take-'no'-for-an-answer \nkid...who kept inviting me to things at his church. Sunday school, youth retreats, \nlock-ins, everything. He wouldn't leave me alone. Finally, he wore me down.&quot; \nFinally he went to the boy's church, &amp; they loved him. The ridicule he expected was absent. \nAfter hearing the pastor explain the purpose of Christ's crucifixion and resurrection, \nhe accepted Jesus as his Savior.\n\nThere is only one way...in view of the above balance scales...of eternal \nassurance of paradise according to Islam: to die a martyr! &quot;The 19 men who \nexecuted the 9/11 attacks on the USA weren't great Muslims...they were \ndesperate Muslims.&quot; It had come to Caner clearly: &quot;I realized Jesus strapped \nHimself to the cross so I didn't have to strap myself to a bomb.&quot;\n\nHis Life Since Jesus Came In:\n\nCaner's father disowned him when he told him about his new faith in Christ. \nThat was the last time he saw his father for 17 years! Harsh? Caner notes, \n&quot;It's not that bad. The Koran says, 'If anyone changes his Islamic religion, \nkill him.' In 38 countries around the world, that is exactly what happens. \nBut my father didn't kill me; he just disowned me.&quot; That church and its members became his family.\n\nEventually, both of his brothers, his mother, and his grandmother came to faith \nin Jesus (his dad died a Muslim). He became professor of theology and church \nhistory at Liberty University. Ergun Caner is the President of Liberty \nTheological Seminary at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia. \nWhen Caner was named to the position in 2005, he became the first former \nMuslim to become the leader of an evangelical seminary.\n\nAs an aside to this testimony, you might be interested in Muslims \nfor Jesus and a note about the extreme objection of Muslims to \nthe truth that Jesus was crucified on the cross\n\n\n\nDios te ama Mi amigo musulmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n - Ex musulmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n ErgÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼n Caner Testimonio\n\n\nAcerca de este testimonio:\n\nHis Life Before Jesus Came In: Su vida antes de JesÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºs se produjo en:\n\nHe was born in about 1960.
