As the series progresses, together they explore the mysteries of Chi's origin and questions about the relationships between humans and persocoms. The manga is set in the same universe as Angelic Layer, taking place a few years after the events of that story, and like Angelic Layer, it explores the relationship between humans and electronic devices shaped like humans.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cff89c14688734fa3dbbef339233790114963215","amp;dn":"Chobits","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cff89c14688734fa3dbbef339233790114963215","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,248,156,20,104,135,52,250,61,187,239,51,146,51,121,1,20,150,50,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
