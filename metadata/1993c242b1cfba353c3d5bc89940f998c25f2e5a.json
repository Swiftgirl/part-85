It is nowhere near as good as the original. They failed to improve on any of the few flaws in the original, added some new ones of their own, and used ancient television studio cameras to give it a really crappy look in attempt to be retro. Worst of all was the acting. None of the performances were original, nor were they competent ripoffs of the excellent original ones. This whole thing is just poor. If you have not seen the original, see it instead of this one. This is only of minor interest to those who are fans of the original and want to see this stupendously poor rendition out of curiosity. \n\nSo, if I think so poorly of it, then why I am seeding it? Because nobody else is. I wanted to see it, and had to go to an awful lot of trouble to do so. Nobody should have to go to a lot of trouble to see this thing. So here it is, for easy access. I hope a couple of others will seed it as well, so those who want it can get it with a minimum of fuss.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1993c242b1cfba353c3d5bc89940f998c25f2e5a","amp;dn":"Failsafe+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1993c242b1cfba353c3d5bc89940f998c25f2e5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,147,194,66,177,207,186,53,60,61,91,200,153,64,249,152,194,95,46,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
