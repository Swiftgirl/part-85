It featured experts from the CATO Institute and one of the authors of the book, &quot;Super Freakonomics&quot;; and studio audience questions and challenges.\n\nJohn took a page from Glenn Beck's playbook (ala his &quot;Red Phone&quot; hotline to the White House) and instituted a &quot;Green Phone&quot; hotline whose direct number has reported to have been given to Al Gore. John criticized Al for steadfastly refusing to appear before any venue where real debate might occur. Like Beck is for his phone, Stossel appeared similarly skeptical it will ever ring.\n\nXvid/MP3 AVI - 624x464 - encoded from clean composite-video SD source","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5af376daa7244cfc59dfdb0c0072ba647a9e1e38","amp;dn":"Stossel+-+%5BGlobal+Climate+Change%5D+-+Fox+Business+-+S01E01+-+CF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5af376daa7244cfc59dfdb0c0072ba647a9e1e38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,243,118,218,167,36,76,252,89,223,219,12,0,114,186,100,122,158,30,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
