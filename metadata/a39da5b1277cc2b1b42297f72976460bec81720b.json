From day 1, Lightroom was designed for photographers and by photographers to help them focus on what they loveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the art and craft of photography. Lightroom provides photographers with an elegant and efficient way to work with their growing digital image collections, bring out the best in their images, and make an impact from raw capture to creative output, all while maintaining the highest possible quality each step of the way.\n\nWe're offering a public beta of the next release of Lightroom to give you a chance to preview some of the new features and enhancements in the upcoming version. It's an opportunity for you to evaluate a select portion of the new features planned for Lightroom 3, to help the team discover and address issues if any, and to send feedback that the Lightroom team can use to make Lightroom 3 an even better digital darkroom and more efficient assistant for you.\nFor the development of this latest release, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve focused on what we believe are the fundamental priorities of our customers: performance and image quality. Lightroom has been rebuilt from its core to provide a performance architecture that meets the needs of photographers today and into the future. The raw processing engine has also received an overhaul in order to ensure that youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re maximizing the potential in your images in terms of sharpening and noise reduction. And, a number of other new areas have also had new features added and enhanced. Like any beta, Lightroom 3 beta is unfinished, which means some of the features we have planned are not in this release, and some of the features in the beta are not yet complete.\n\nSome of the new features included for you to play with in the Lightroom 3 beta are:\n\n    * Brand new performance architecture, building for the future of growing image libraries\n    * State-of-the-art noise reduction to help you perfect your high ISO shots\n    * Watermarking tool that helps you customize and protect your images with ease\n    * Portable sharable slideshows with audioÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½designed to give you more flexibility and impact on how you choose to share your images, you can now save and export your slideshows as videos and include audio\n    * Flexible customizable print package creation so your print package layouts are all your own\n    * Film grain simulation tool for enhancing your images to look as gritty as you want\n    * New import handling designed to make importing streamlined and easy\n    * More flexible online publishing options so you can post your images online to certain online photo sharing sites directly from inside Lightroom 3 beta (may require third-party plug-ins)*\n-----------------------------------------------\nSuper Fast Upload by DUBAY 10.000kbs\n-----------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a39da5b1277cc2b1b42297f72976460bec81720b","amp;dn":"Adobe+Lightroom+3+Beta+for+PC+and+MAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a39da5b1277cc2b1b42297f72976460bec81720b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,157,165,177,39,124,194,177,180,34,151,247,41,118,70,11,236,129,114,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
