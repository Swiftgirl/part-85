It is now widely used and earning a reputation as a benchmark   \n  in rendering technology.                                                 \n                                                                           \n  Some of its features include ray tracing, global illumination (including \n  photon mapping, final gathering and high dynamic range lighting and      \n  rendering), realistic motion blur, depth of field, complete geometry     \n  support (including efficient rendering of hair and fur), programmable    \n  shaders, quality antialiasing and antialiased shadow maps.
