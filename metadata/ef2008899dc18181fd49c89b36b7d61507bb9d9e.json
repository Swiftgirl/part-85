It is told with humour (much of it quite subtle, almost surreal, and in the background - imagine a street scene where everyone on the sidewalk on one side of the road walks in just one direction, and on the other side in the other), poignancy, and a frequent breaking of the 4th wall between the movie and the audience (think of what happens in Shakespeare's plays, and you'll be close). It also features some songs by Novella Matveyeva, a famous Russian singer-songwriter (her songs are sung by the leading actress).\n\nWithout revealing the details of the plot, I will just say this: this film is not very friendly to Communist ideology. One should not take that to mean, as some critics have, that it is simply a metaphor for Klimov's own experiences as a filmmaker, or that its criticism applies to Communism alone. To do that would be to miss the point. The film's final message (that society inevitably ostracizes those who are gifted) applies to all societies everywhere. It cannot be any other way - the gifted people in any society are, by definition, significantly outnumbered. In light of this, the film could be called a pro-elitist one. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img30.imageshack.us/img30/5956/bscap0099b.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img30.imageshack.us/img30/5956/bscap0099b.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img21.imageshack.us/img21/4302/bscap0100v.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img21.imageshack.us/img21/4302/bscap0100v.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img39.imageshack.us/img39/9113/bscap0103pli.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img39.imageshack.us/img39/9113/bscap0103pli.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img27.imageshack.us/img27/9697/bscap0106g.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img27.imageshack.us/img27/9697/bscap0106g.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img21.imageshack.us/img21/1949/bscap0107t.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img21.imageshack.us/img21/1949/bscap0107t.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----not my rip------\n\nFile Name .........................................: Pokhozhdeniya zubnogo vracha.avi\n\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,379,594,240 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:16:52\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: DivX 5.x/6.x\nFrame Size ......................................: 720x384 (AR: 1.875)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1999 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.289 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 384 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\n********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
