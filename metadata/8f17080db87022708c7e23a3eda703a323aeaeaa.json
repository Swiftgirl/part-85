It's free! This version can run on any PC with Java 1.5/1.6/1.7 installed.\n\n* Upload increase up to 1000%\n\nExpert features:\n1. Seeder Mode: tracker will see you as seeder and not as a leecher. You can download anything without care about your ratio. I love this feature. Even without upload increase I can download anything :D\n2. Network problems emulation: Tracker will not see uploading/downloading at all.\n\n\nMore info:\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.torrentratiokeeper.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=224&amp;p=470#p470&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.torrentratiokeeper.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=224&amp;p=470#p470&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f17080db87022708c7e23a3eda703a323aeaeaa","amp;dn":"TorrentRatioKeeper+Monster+v3.5+for+Linux%2FMacOS%2FBSD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f17080db87022708c7e23a3eda703a323aeaeaa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,23,8,13,184,112,34,112,140,126,35,163,237,167,3,163,35,174,174,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
