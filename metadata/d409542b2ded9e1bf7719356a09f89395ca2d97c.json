There are no guests, but he does take a number of calls.\n\n\nTopics include the top stories of the week past, with special attention for some.\n\n\nOsama bin Laden rises from the grave to make a new audio recording in which he takes credit for the Crotch Bomber; cops in Pittsburg, PA beat up a honor student walking to his grandmother's house because he was carrying a Mt. Dew bottle; the increasing use of flying drones by police; etc., etc..\n\n\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
