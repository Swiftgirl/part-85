The album has a slightly more psychedelic and even paranoid sound than that of their debut. Wild Planet also contains the band's first experiments using electronic drum machines.\n\nAs with their debut, The B-52's travelled to the Bahamas to record Wild Planet. Several of the songs from the album had been concert staples since 1977 but were omitted from the debut album by choice of the producer, Chris Blackwell. More emphasis was put on production for Wild Planet with the tracks having more of a slick feeling than the first album. It was fairly well received by critics, most of whom regarded it as a strong sophomore album following the success of the eponymous debut. Wild Planet was quickly certified gold.\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs written by Fred Schneider, Keith Strickland, Ricky Wilson, Cindy Wilson, and Kate Pierson, except as indicated.\n\n1.&quot;Party out of Bounds&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:21\n2.&quot;Dirty Back Road&quot; (R.
