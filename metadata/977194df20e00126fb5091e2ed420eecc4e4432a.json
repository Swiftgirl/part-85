Dramatically narrated by Daniel Sunjata       \n           of FX s Rescue Me, and an outspoken advocate for the           \n           First Responders, Loose Change 9/11: An American Coup          \n           first examines mysterious and infamous events that             \n           reshaped world history from the Reichstag Fire in 1933         \n           that catapulted Hitler to dictatorship - to the Gulf of        \n           Tonkin Incident in 1964 that led to the Vietnam War, and       \n           then takes viewers on a turbulent journey through several      \n           pivotal moments in history before delving into the most        \n           significant catastrophe in recent memory, 9/11. Loaded         \n           with powerful, new footage and in-depth interviews with        \n           the likes of Steven Earl Jones, an American physicist who      \n           has discovered undetonated explosive material in multiple      \n           samples of dust from the World Trade Center collapses,         \n           this documentary presents a wide array of evidence both        \n           known and unknown...until now. Eight years later, the          \n           American people continue to live in the aftermath of 9/11      \n           and deal with its ongoing repercussions. Is this just          \n           another machination of power on the timeline of history?       \n           If so, the real question is what happens next? Or better       \n           yet, what can we do to prevent another 9/11? The film          \n           serves as a fundamental call to action which is fueled by      \n           hope that those affected by 9/11 will soon receive the         \n           answers that they have sought after for nearly a decade.       \n                                                                          \n                                                    \n                        \n                            \n                                 \n                                                                          \n           George W.
