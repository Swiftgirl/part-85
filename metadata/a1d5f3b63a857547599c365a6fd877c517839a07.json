Since then, I've improved my &quot;studio&quot; quite a bit and also have unearthed a few more recordings. There's also been two more tours.\n\nI was recently listening to those discs and decided they don't really sound all that great. So I decided to &quot;remaster&quot; all of them and recreate some of them. I think they sound much better. And they are more complete.\n\nAs to why I ever did this:\n\n1. I love raw live recordings.\n2. I wanted just one disc from every tour instead of 10 of each in which the difference between the discs was one song.\n3. My fanship of JJ is based largely on his constant innovation and reinterpretation of his own (and others) music. This set reflects that.\n\nWith special thanks to Jeff, Bjoern, John N., Gert, Maura, Carol, Bladerunner and especially Phillip (hope I didn't forget anyone), I was able to accumulate enough different shows from every tour that I think I had at least one version of every song played.\n\nFrom there, I took the best sounding version of each song and created a master list. From the master list, I took as many songs as I could fit on an 80 minute disc, in order of songs I most wanted to have from each tour. Then, using Sound Forge, I blended all of the songs together so that they sound like one show with no breaks of silence, and remastered each song as\nbest as I could (not everything was salvageable - like &quot;Moonlight&quot; from 1983 - but I put it on anyway because I like the song so much) and balanced the sound levels.\n\nI hope you will find it all worth it. It took me about two months to complete the original set and a month to complete this one, but I am very happy with the finished product. Now if only the record companies could have done this for me...\n\nAs always, these are not for sale - either by me or anyone who receives one. These are strictly for trade and personal enjoyment. I do not take it for granted the legal questions surrounding this and ask that everyone be respectful of JJ and his management and thankful that they allowed me to share this the first time (and presumably this time, as well).\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe Joe Jackson Tour History Collection 1982-1983\n\nDisc 4-A\n\n01  On Your Radio\n02  Another World\n03  Cosmopolitan\n04  Sunday Papers\n05  Look Sharp\n06  Fools In Love\n07  Target &gt; \n08  TV Age\n09  Cancer\n10  Tuxedo Junction\n\nSources:\nTracks 01, 02, 04-08:  12/9/82 - Orpheum, Boston, MA (&quot;In Concert&quot; radio broadcast)\nTracks 03, 09, 10:  2/21/83 - Markthalle, Hamburg, Germany (&quot;Rockpalast&quot; television broadcast)\n\nDisc 4-B\n\n01  It's Different For Girls\n02  &quot;Motown Medley&quot;\n\tUptight (Everything's Alright) &gt;\n\tTears of a Clown &gt; \n\tI'm Gonna Make You Love Me &gt; \n\tHow Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You) &gt; \n\tHeat Wave &gt; \n\tUptight (reprise)\n03  Beat Crazy\n04  Got the Time\n05  A Slow Song\n06  I'm the Man\n07  Steppin' Out\n08  Moonlight\n09  What's It All About, Alfie\n\nSources:\nTracks 01, 03-06:  12/9/82 - Orpheum, Boston, MA (&quot;In Concert&quot; radio broadcast)\nTrack 02:  2/21/83 - Markthalle, Hamburg, Germany (&quot;Rockpalast&quot; television broadcast)\nTrack 07:  1/22/83 - Regal Theatre, Hitchin, England (&quot;Sight and Sound - In Concert&quot;, BBC Radio 1 broadcast)\nTrack 08:  2/12/83 - audience recording, Rouen, France\nTrack 09:  c. 1982 - &quot;Countdown&quot;, Dutch television broadcast\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1d5f3b63a857547599c365a6fd877c517839a07","amp;dn":"Joe+Jackson+Tour+History+Collection+-+1982-1983","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1d5f3b63a857547599c365a6fd877c517839a07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,213,243,182,58,133,117,71,89,156,54,90,111,216,119,197,23,131,154,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
