The first part was originally advertised as an &quot;ABC Family Original Movie&quot;, but nearly a year later, it was followed up with two other parts of equal length over the course of a weekend. Fallen stars Paul Wesley as Aaron Corbett, a good-natured high school student who discovers he is half-human/half-angel. The series inspired a reality game on abcfamily.com which won an interactive Emmy.&quot;\n\n\nI noticed this was hard to find online, so here's part one. No subtitles, spoken language English. There are 2 parts to follow, but I only have the third part. I'll upload the second when I get hold of it.\n\nPlease help seed this when you've downloaded it :)\n\nEDIT: \n\nPart 2: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5547898\nPart 3: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5547053","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a9649ce3cf32e02b56e9337be380190b183d252","amp;dn":"The+Fallen+-+The+Beginning+%28part+one%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a9649ce3cf32e02b56e9337be380190b183d252","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,150,73,206,60,243,46,2,181,110,147,55,190,56,1,144,177,131,210,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
