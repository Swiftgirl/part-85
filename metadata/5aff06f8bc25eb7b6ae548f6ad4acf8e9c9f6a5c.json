No Tools like Nlite is used. Our aim was to create a version which is fairly stable with no flashy content like the other modified Windows running around. Normal Nlite based modified Windows might show some problems when updating/repairing a current windows setup. So about RockStable - Though we got the final aim of having a pretty stable edition, it has just one problem - its huge size. But we feel that this will be worth it.\n\nCD-Key: V2C47-MK7JD-3R89F-D2KXW-VPK3J\t\n\nRegards,\nHoodiboY for RocksTeam\n\nFor further discussion/opinion/critcs come to  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://rocksteam.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://rocksteam.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5aff06f8bc25eb7b6ae548f6ad4acf8e9c9f6a5c","amp;dn":"Windows+XP+x86+Professional+-+updated+upto+Dec+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5aff06f8bc25eb7b6ae548f6ad4acf8e9c9f6a5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,255,6,248,188,37,235,123,106,229,72,246,173,74,207,142,156,159,106,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
