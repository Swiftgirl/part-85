Each clip is used with permission of their respective creators. We encourage you to visit their channels, subscribe if you like what you see, and shower them with milk, honey, and 72 ripe dates (I think that's the right translation...)\n\nThe DVD as a whole is shared under a &quot;Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 2.5 Canadian License&quot;. In plain English, you're allowed (nay, encouraged!) to copy this disc as much as you like, so long as you don't profit from it, and any tweaked versions you create are shared in the same way as the original. You may charge a fee to cover the costs incurred in creating a physical copy, but again: no profits! For some reason, we carry a grudge against them.\n\nAaaaand we're all disclaimered out.
