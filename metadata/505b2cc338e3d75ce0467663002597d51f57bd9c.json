The fourth kind is abduction.\n&gt;\n&gt; Plot Synopsis: In 1972, a scale of measurement was established for alien encounters.\n&gt; When a UFO is sighted, it is called an encounter of the first kind. When evidence is\n&gt; collected, it is known as an encounter of the second kind. When contact is made with\n&gt; extraterrestrials, it is the third kind. The next level, abduction, is the fourth kind.\n&gt; Modern-day, Alaska, where-mysteriously since the 1960s-a disproportionate number of\n&gt; the population has been reported missing every year. Despite multiple FBI investigations\n&gt; of the region, the truth has never been discovered. Here in this remote region,\n&gt; psychologist Dr. Abigail Tyler began videotaping sessions with traumatized patients and\n&gt; unwittingly discovered some of the most disturbing evidence of alien abduction ever\n&gt; documented. The Fourth Kind exposes the terrified revelations of multiple witnesses.\n&gt; Their accounts of being visited by alien figures all share disturbingly identical\n&gt; details, the validity of which is investigated throughout the film.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Shouts To:\n&gt; Ripwyn, Grey Shadow, Noir, Mustangx, Torrent Force, 1337x.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ENJOY!\n\n**********************************************************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:505b2cc338e3d75ce0467663002597d51f57bd9c","amp;dn":"The+Fourth+Kind%5B2009%5D+DvDrip+H.264+AAC+-+Westy1983","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"505b2cc338e3d75ce0467663002597d51f57bd9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,91,44,195,56,227,215,92,224,70,118,99,0,37,151,213,31,87,189,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
