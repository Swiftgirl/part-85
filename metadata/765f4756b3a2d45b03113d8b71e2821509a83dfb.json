Alice (Brittany Murphy) has just suffered a total mental collapse, and her career will be on the line if she fails to complete her screenplay soon. Feeling unsafe in the city, Alice retreats to an abandoned house in the middle of nowhere. Before long, she's hearing strange sounds and seeing fleeting apparitions out of the corner of her vision. Curious, Alice begins exploring the sprawling home and discovers a collection of videotapes hidden away in the attic. The content on the tapes is disturbing to say the least, but the more Alice watches, the more intrigued she becomes. What ever happened to the couple (Marc Blucas and Thora Birch) that made them, and what is the malevolent force that seems to be tracing her every move? Her deadline closing in fast, Alice watches helplessly as reality begins to distort and fragile psyche starts to crumble all over again.\n\nRun Time: 89 Mins.\n\nCast:\n* Brittany Murphy - Alice\n* Tammy Blanchard - Rebecca\n* Claudia Troll - David's Mother\n\n* Thora Birch - Lucy\n* Marc Blucas - David\n* Michael Piscitelli - Ben\n\n\nDirector(s):\nSean McConville\n\nWriter(s):\nSean McConville\n\nProducer(s):\nRoger Betterton\n\nCategories:\nMystery &amp; Suspense, Horror\n\n\nPlease seed and comment my torrents.
