Based on never-before-seen government documents and newly discovered letters written by Al Capone himself, Get Capone presents America's greatest gangster as youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve never seen him before.\n\nIn addition to IRS files, Eig got hold of the personal papers of the U.S. attorney in Chicago who prosecuted Capone. He even found family members who would share stories about their notorious relative. The author, a former reporter for the Wall Street Journal, brings his uncompromising standards for research and his superb knack for storytelling to one of the most thrilling stories in American history. This eye-opening biography reveals that Capone was the target of one of the most intense criminal investigations in American history - with orders coming directly from the White House. Capone flaunted his criminal success so openly that President Hoover insisted the gangster be stopped. And, despite his many misdeeds, Capone may have been the victim of a rigged trial. \n\nGet Capone also offers a bold new theory to explain the Valentine's Day Massacre and sheds new light on Capone's connection - or lack thereof - to the crime.\n\n\nWhat the Critics Say &quot;Eig presents a multifaceted portrait of a shrewd man who built a criminal empire worth millions.&quot; (Publishers Weekly)\n\n\nLENGTH\n17 hrs and 17 mins \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b53ada8af1b6da69eca065956eeb5be8e4ea862d","amp;dn":"Get+Capone+-+Jonathan+Eig++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b53ada8af1b6da69eca065956eeb5be8e4ea862d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,58,218,138,241,182,218,105,236,160,101,149,110,235,91,232,228,234,134,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
