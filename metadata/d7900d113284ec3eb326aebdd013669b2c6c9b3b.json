This also will assure the game \n                works without errors. Not saying it will not work in dvd format \n                but that requires extended testing to insure it works as a rebuild \n                to dvd but Im low on dvd's so I had to leave original.\n\n\nNote: No Ps2 backup disc/game or copy will work unless your Ps2 Console is Modded \n      (allows playing of backups), or if you use Swap Magic.\n      \n\nYou could try the homebrew exploit to (Free Mc Boot - Also known as soft modding for ps2), if your ps2 system isn't hard modded with a chip or if Swap Magic isn't working as a last resort. There are ps2 emulators but its not 100% &amp; the quality isn't as good as playing your game on your ps2 console.\n\nIf your using swap magic and don't have a flip top, you'll need to first\nremove the front cover of the disc tray for use of the slide card.\n\nHere's a link for how to remove the front cover...\n         &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.modchipstore.com/support/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&amp;_a=viewarticle&amp;kbarticleid=49&amp;nav=0,2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.modchipstore.com/support/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&amp;_a=viewarticle&amp;kbarticleid=49&amp;nav=0,2&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAnd here's some links on using the slide tool to open the tray to swap in your ps2 copy or backup game.\n         &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.swapmagic3.com/slide-tool/Instructions.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.swapmagic3.com/slide-tool/Instructions.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/340944&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/340944&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/15105&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/15105&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThose that don't have a modded Ps2 Here's a few links for Free MC Boot &amp; how to use it to soft mod your ps2 so you can be able to play burned games. Free Mc Boot won't work on newer models of ps2 you'll have to use an older version the tutorial explains this.\n\n-- &lt;a href=&quot; http://bootleg.sksapps.com/tutorials/fmcb/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://bootleg.sksapps.com/tutorials/fmcb/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThen you will also need to patch the iso (the PS2 game) with ESR disc patcher GUI v0.24a if your using free mc boot with ESR Elf to boot your p2 copies or backups (No-swapping required for esr method).\n\nAfter patching burn the iso with Imgburn or Dvd Decrypter to respectable media\nthen use the ESR through fmcb after you installed everything to boot your game.\n\nYou will still need to use the proper media for the game to run or load properly regardless if your using fmcb, a modded ps2, or swap magic. Verbatim or Taiyo yuden is preferred.\n\nNote: If fmcb isn't working and your Ps2 isn't Modded, Swap Magic should do the\ntrick.\n\n\nGame Description:\n\nRobot Alchemic Driver, or commonly known as RAD, is a Big Robot / Monster fight in a modern city with a twist. There is a story mode / training mode and a 2 player vs mode. In a nut shell, alienÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s attack the last city on earth. The big robot comes up, and here is where the twist come in, you have to control the robot from the perspective of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œheroÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (three to choose from) and you can switch between the robot / hero mode. This forces you to make sure you have a strategic position to move the hero around in the city to see the battle without getting too close. As the game goes on you have the option to update/customize the mech(s) to improve them. You can end up destroying whole building / terrain as you battle the alien monster. \n\nPrepare to bond with 75 tons of high-tensile robot. Direct every movement of your machine and slug your way to victory over colossal opponents in brutal hand-to-hand combat (plus missiles, lasers, shooting fists, boomerangs, and much more). Freeway overpass in the way? Take it down. Buildings crowding you? Knock 'em over. \n\nMuch more than a simple action game, Robot Alchemic Drive accurately simulates the operation of a remote-controlled metal titan in crowded, active urban environments. Use your giant robot as a tool to defeat enemies, complete missions, and much more.\n\nTreat your robot well and you will be rewarded. Abuse your robot and, well, you'll wish you hadn't.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Concurrent gameplay occurs on two levels: The Robot plane and the human plane. \n\n* Unique control mechanism simulates remote control of huge robots.\n\n* Robots can transform into an alternate form.\n\n* Fully usable/destructible environments - if you see it, you can crush it, stomp \n  on it, knock it down. Head up to the top of a skyscraper to view the action.\n\n* Intense graphics bring crammed urban cities to life. Classically designed robots \n  move/transform realistically.\n\n* Innovative design enables incredible sense of scale.\n\n* R&amp;D system enables customization and enhancement of robots.\n\n* Story-driven gameplay provides depth lacking in other &quot;giant robot&quot; titles. \n\n* Character designs by Toshihiro Kawamoto of hit Anime &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;.\n\n\nGame Pics Included.\n\n\nBurn with Alcohol 120%, (Included in download).  \n\nSet Datatype to Playstation 2, (Write Method Raw/Dao) and Burn at 8x speed.\n\nUse Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden CD-R Media for best quality, or if other media isn't working.\n\n(No CD-RW will not work).\n\n\nAny Problems or questions please post a comment.\n\n\nIf this is working fine for you let us know write a comment.\n\n\nPlease Seed this when your done.\n\n(I can't seed 24/7, do your part and seed to keep the torrent healthy).\n\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7900d113284ec3eb326aebdd013669b2c6c9b3b","amp;dn":"R.A.D.+-+Robot+Alchemic+Drive+%5BNtsc%5D%2C+Ps2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7900d113284ec3eb326aebdd013669b2c6c9b3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,144,13,17,50,132,236,62,179,38,174,189,208,19,102,155,44,108,155,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
