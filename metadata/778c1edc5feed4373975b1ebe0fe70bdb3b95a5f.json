Using a wizard-like program for your\n          conversions is helpful in the beginning, but for users who have\n          the perfect system setup, having to click through each step,\n          and every screen for every DVD or video file you want to\n          convert becomes tiresome and slows you down. DVD Catalyst 3 is\n          uniquely designed to convert movies with as little clicks as\n          possible - and even 1 click and no click modes are available! \n\n         Converts all DVDs and all common video files to a format that\n          can be played on virtually any portable device, including new\n          codec standards and releases as well as DIVX, XVID, AVI, MPEG,\n          MPEG4, TiVo, DVR-MS (SD), TS, FLV, ISO, MDF \n\n         Does not need any additional software for accessing protected\n          DVDs\n\n         Unrestricted 7-day trial. No 5 minute test conversions, no\n          files that need to be recreated after you purchase the program.\n          After the trial expires, just install the purchased version and\n          continue where you left off - including retaining your\n          personalised settings! \n\n         Converts to all common video file formats, including AVC, H264,\n          MP4, DIVX, XVID, WMV, 3GP, MPEG\n\n         Includes an ever expanding list of conversion profiles for all\n          the popular devices on the market, including Pocket PC,\n          Smartphone, XBOX 360, Playstation3, PSP, iPod Nano, iPod\n          Classic, iPod Touch, iPhone, AppleTV, Archos, Zen. If your\n          device is not listed, you can try using a profile from a\n          similar device, or modify the settings according to its\n          specifications. If you need help, just email us the\n          specifications of your device, and we'll do what we can to make\n          it work. There is no need to purchase the same program for\n          other devices. \n\n         Complete freedom on quality settings and target size. You can\n          adjust the settings for the best possible quality, small file\n          size or anything in-between. \n\n         Multi-Device queue. DVD Catalyst 3 is the ONLY application on\n          the market that allows you to queue up as many devices as you\n          want for conversions. If you have a variety of devices and you\n          want to watch movies on all of them, DVD Catalyst is your best\n          choice. Queue up your iPhone, the Wife/Daughters Nano and your\n          son's PSP in DVD Catalyst 3, pop in a DVD and click 'Go'. \n\n         Automatic batching. Multiple DVD drives, video files, video\n          folders are all automatically queued up for conversion. You can\n          even have DVD Catalyst 3 monitor your Video Recording folders\n          (from MediaCenter, TiVo desktop etc) to check for new files\n          whenever they are available. \n\n         Automatic (0 Click) conversion. You can have DVD Catalyst\n          automatically start a conversion when a DVD is inserted; a new\n          video file is added to your folders. All of the options in DVD\n          Catalyst 3 can be set for automatic mode, including cropping\n          and language/subtitle selections. You can have it run\n          automatically when your computer starts up, so you never have\n          to see the program again. Install it on a Home Theatre PC\n          (HTPC) and when it's done with a DVD, it will be ejected\n          without ever having to click a button. \n\n         Automatic black bar (letterbox) removal. For all conversions,\n          DVD Catalyst 3 can remove black bars. It doesn't matter what\n          kind of screen your device has, movies will always look full\n          screen. \n\n         80+ page PDF manual. While you do not need to read the manual\n          to be able to use DVD Catalyst 3, all of its features are\n          explained in detail. It includes documentation on various\n          aspects of getting video content on a portable device, as well\n          as example scenarios on how to set it up for certain tasks. \n\n         Support. All DVD Catalyst users who had questions for us are\n          impressed by the way we provide support. We always answer\n          within a day, and mostly even within a few hours. We do not\n          pile up support requests, and we actually do what we can to\n          help. On www.dvdcatalystgt.com we provide a support forum as\n          well as email support for assisting our users with whatever\n          issue they might have. \n\n\n        Requirements: \n\n        DVD Catalyst 3 runs on all versions of Windows 2000, Windows XP\n        and Windows Vista. \n\n        As for specific hardware requirements; DVD Catalyst will take\n        anything that is able to run one of the supported base operating\n        systems. Of course the faster the processor and the faster the\n        DVD drive/Hard drive, the faster the conversions. \n\n        Multi-core (Dual, Quad) and multi-processor are also supported\n        and used optimally for almost all conversion operations (all\n        iPod-related, AVC and H264 formats). For conversion to other\n        video formats multi-core helps. \n\n\n        Whats New in v3.84?:\n\n        Important:\n         Due to issues with the protection system, the trial version has\n          been changed to convert 20% of Movies, TV Shows and Video\n          files.\n\n        NEW:\n         Verizon/Motorola Droid Profile added, existing profiles\n          modified to use actual device resolution (854480)\n         New HTC Android models added (Hero, Milestone)\n         Forced Subtitles Checkmark added (was always enabled in\n          previous versions)\n         CPU indicator checkmark (turn off to [...]\n\n\n\n        For More Information On DVD Catalyst 3 Visit:\n       &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.dvdcatalystgt.com/products/dvd%20catalyst%203.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.dvdcatalystgt.com/products/dvd%20catalyst%203.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n                      TE Release Filename: tdvc384x.zip\n\n                                                      \n                                                              \n                                      \n              INSTALLATION NOTES         \n                                                   \n                                                               \n                                                             \n                                                                        \n\n        Install dc384tr.exe found in the &quot;Setup&quot; folder FIRST.
