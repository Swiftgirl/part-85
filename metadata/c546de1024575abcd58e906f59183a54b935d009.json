In order to read this manual you need \n  Adobe Acrobat Reader installed on your machine.

No data is sent to clickteam.com during this connection.\n  You can prevent MMF2 connecting to clickteam.com by selecting &quot;Never&quot;\n  in the Check For Update group options in the Preferences.\n\n  Note: on some very old versions of Windows 95, the program may get stuck at startup. \n  In this case, press Ctrl-Alt-Del, kill\n the program, and then restart it while pressing \n  the CTRL key and select &quot;Never&quot; in the Check For Update options in the Preferences.\n\n* Make backups: as for any software, especially beta software, \n  we recommend you backup your applications on a regular basis. \n\n\nIf you have any other question about Multimedia Fusion 2, please visit our Web\nsite, http://www.clickteam.com.\n\n\nThank you for using Clickteam products!\n\n\nThe Clickteam.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c546de1024575abcd58e906f59183a54b935d009","amp;dn":"Darkloader.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c546de1024575abcd58e906f59183a54b935d009","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,70,222,16,36,87,90,188,213,142,144,111,89,24,58,84,185,53,208,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
