I might seem like it should turn out dated and completely\nuninteresting but nothing could be more wrong when it comes to Aggressive Chill.\n\nThe leading track &quot;Cockroach&quot; starts of with a solid guitar riff leading you to\nbelieve that this is well crafted but pretty ordinary hard rock. Two minutes\ninto that song when the symphonic orchestra is introduced the song takes on a\n007 Bond kind of feel and it all kicks off into the stratosphere. The second\nsong, &quot;Done by a fool&quot; starts of with great singing over a simple guitar riff\nbefore it turns into a killer tune, just making us eager to hear more. During\n&quot;Insomnia&quot; it is time to bring the strings up front in the massive power ballad.\nThis tune could have worked as soundtrack to the movie Armageddon just as well\nas Aerosmith did. You get the picture?\n\n&quot;Empathy&quot; is a faster and overall harder track showcasing some faster riffing\nand distorted vocals. We really believe that a tune like &quot;Empathy will work well\nduring the live set. Still it comes across as an average track on the album and\nit doesn't impress us much.\n\nThe first four tracks of the album really present the diversity of Agressive\nChill in the best possible manner, from here on you know what you are going to\nget. The strongest compositions on the album are &quot;Done by a fool&quot;, Insomnia&quot;,\n&quot;Understand me&quot; and &quot;Rust&quot;.\n\nAs soon as you get a sip of the blended result you will know that Aggressive\nChill possess something that's quite rare these days. They posses good taste and\na capability to capture that on tape. Aggressive Chill use that what have been\nused by thousands of bands before them still they manage to produce great music\nwith an original feel.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0991b79fc8b3a0883d3dc8c54be399036cfe6f88","amp;dn":"Aggressive_Chill-Destination_7734-2009-PMS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0991b79fc8b3a0883d3dc8c54be399036cfe6f88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,145,183,159,200,179,160,136,61,61,200,197,75,227,153,3,108,254,111,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
