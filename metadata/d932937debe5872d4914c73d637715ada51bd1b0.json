Unlike their previous albums Tons of Sobs and Free it was a success, reaching #2 in the UK charts and #17 in the American, making it the most successful Free album. This is due to the album containing the hit single &quot;All Right Now&quot; which they later played to a crowd of over 600,000 people at the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival, which generated them popularity. To this date it is the only Free album to have seen a CD reissue in America.\n\nThe album and single were both successesful. Fees for live shows rose to Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£1000 (a considerable amount in 1970) and they began to be featured in radio station and music magazines.\n\nFree were an English rock band, formed in London in 1968 and best known for their popular song &quot;All Right Now&quot;. Lead singer Paul Rodgers went on to become lead singer of the rock band Bad Company along with Simon Kirke on drums. Lead guitarist Paul Kossoff, a much revered blues-rock guitarist, died from a drug-induced heart failure at the age of 25 in 1976.\n\nThe band was famed for its sensational live shows and nonstop touring. However, early studio albums did not sell very well ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ until the release of Fire and Water which featured the massive hit &quot;All Right Now&quot;. This album brought them to full status as one of the top rock bands of the 1960sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“70s. The song helped secure them a place at the huge Isle of Wight Festival 1970 where they played to 600,000 people.\n\nRolling Stone has referred to the band as &quot;British hard rock pioneers&quot;.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d932937debe5872d4914c73d637715ada51bd1b0","amp;dn":"Free+-+Mr.+Big++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d932937debe5872d4914c73d637715ada51bd1b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,50,147,125,235,229,135,45,73,20,199,61,99,119,21,173,165,27,209,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
