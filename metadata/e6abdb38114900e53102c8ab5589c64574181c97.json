New to this version is nearly 100 questions on the application of Skinner's analysis of verbal behavior.  This brings the total number of questions for the entire series to over 2,100 questions.  Also new to v6 is updated references to Cooper, Heron, Heward (2007).  We've also revised a handful of questions, removed the login requirement, and added an additional unlimited time run.\n\nThe CBA Learning Module Series is not a practice test. Several questions are used to teach each concept. The student should practice the module until she gets all of them correct in the allotted time.  It doesn't take that long to go through the modules to get to 100% proficiency, and it's a fun way to review the material because it requires an active response.  The program keeps track of your progress and you can print out or e-mail reports from inside the program.  You can e-mail BDS any questions you have about specific items while you're working on the exercise.  Also, when finished with an exercise, you can review the questions you missed.\n\nEach of the 2100+ questions includes:\n\n    * four multiple choice options\n    * corrective feedback for each option\n    * a hint\n    * a text book reference for more information on that topic\n\nInappropriate memorization is controlled by:\n\n    * randomizing the order of the questions\n    * randomizing the placement of the options\n    * making incorrect options almost correct\n    * and several other strategies\n\nThe time criterion assures that fluent responding is achievedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the kind of learning that leads to retention.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6abdb38114900e53102c8ab5589c64574181c97","amp;dn":"CBA+Learning+Module","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6abdb38114900e53102c8ab5589c64574181c97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,171,219,56,17,73,0,229,49,2,200,171,85,137,198,69,116,24,28,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
