It is commercial-free.  Most of the editing I did was to shorten the classical music interludes.  Downside: this is 32K bitrate rather than the 64K I have been uploading.  Upside, there's none of the content chopping that occurs sometimes on the GCN 64K podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance. I try to share information\n that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.\n NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as\n information.
