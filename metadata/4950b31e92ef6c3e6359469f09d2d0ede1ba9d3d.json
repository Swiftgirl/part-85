Using donations from his congregation, he slowly transformed his church into a fully functioning movie studio, and the production company Christian WYSIWYG Filmworks was born.\n\nAfter experimenting on a number of small projects, Pastor Richard Gazowsky announced that he and his WYSIWYG crew were going to make a film entitled, GRAVITY: THE SHADOW OF JOSEPH, a biblical science fiction movie that would redefine the Hollywood epic. AUDIENCE OF ONE is a documentary that chronicles the making of GRAVITY. Full of humor and pathos, what transpires is a story of obsession, faith and delusion.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4950b31e92ef6c3e6359469f09d2d0ede1ba9d3d","amp;dn":"Audience+Of+One+%28Documentary+similar+to+American+Movie%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4950b31e92ef6c3e6359469f09d2d0ede1ba9d3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,80,179,30,146,239,108,62,99,89,70,159,9,210,208,237,225,186,157,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
