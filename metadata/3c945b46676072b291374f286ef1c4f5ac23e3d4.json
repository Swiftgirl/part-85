It allows you to perform a complete uninstall without having to rely on the supplied Add Remove program, which can leave files or changes behind.\nTotal Uninstall creates a snapshot of your system prior to installing a new program. It then takes an additional snapshot after the installation has completed. It then compares the two snapshots and displays all changes in a graphical tree view, marking all registry values and/or files that have been added, changed or deleted. Total Uninstall saves these changes and, if you decide to uninstall the program, it will reverse the changes to the previous state.\nFeatures\n\n    * Accurate analyze existing installations and create a log with installation changes.\n    * Monitor changes from registry and file system for new installations.\n    * Uninstall completely and thoroughly analyzed or monitored programs.\n    * List without delay installed or monitored programs and with appropriate icons.\n    * Organize in groups installed or monitored programs.\n    * Find the program to uninstall by keyword quickly and easily.\n    * Summary and detailed information for each installed or monitored program.\n    * User configurable views of the detected changes.\n    * It shows a detailed uninstall log.\n    * Powerful search in detected changes.\n    * Standalone and low resource usage agent for notification of running installation programs\n    * Export registry changes for install or uninstall\n    * Export installed or monitored programs list to file\n    * Export to file or print detected changes\n    * View and apply pending file rename operations without restart.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c945b46676072b291374f286ef1c4f5ac23e3d4","amp;dn":"Total+Uninstall+Pro+v+5.4.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c945b46676072b291374f286ef1c4f5ac23e3d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,148,91,70,103,96,114,178,145,55,79,40,110,241,196,245,172,35,227,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
