Until, that is, he develops his own selection of super powers and unveils himself to Metropolis as a new superhero - Mr Action. As his powers only manifest themselves when heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s in danger, Olsen has to tread a fine line between power and danger, but can he really handle his new found powers? And can Superman train him to use them responsibly?\n\nWritten by Kurt Busiek and pencilled by Brad Walker.\n\n\n\nTracked by http://comicpirates.info\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8356e7e8682f5e384a1c97ee9c19f6c9e63bc5ca","amp;dn":"Superman+-+3-2-1+Action+Story-Arc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8356e7e8682f5e384a1c97ee9c19f6c9e63bc5ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,86,231,232,104,47,94,56,74,28,151,238,156,25,246,201,230,59,197,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
