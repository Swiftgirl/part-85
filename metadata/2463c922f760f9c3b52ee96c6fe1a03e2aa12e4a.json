But Renbourn is never just about empty virtuosity. His playing invariably serves only the needs of the song. SHIP OF FOOLS is a must-own for Renbourn fans.\n\nSHIP OF FOOLS harks back to earlier John Renbourn solo efforts like the classic SIR JOHN A LOT or THE LADY AND THE UNICORN. The one important addition is vocalist Maggie Boyle, whose ethereal voice recalls the late Sandy Denny but is very much its own instrument. Boyle sings on many of these songs, and her dreamy tones beautifully match the sonorities of Renbourn's six and 12-string acoustic guitars (often overdubbed, as on the driving title track).\n\nPersonnel includes: John Renbourn (vocals, guitar, cittern); Steve Tilston (vocals, guitar, mandolin); Tony Roberts (flute, pipes, clarinet, saxophone, background vocals); Maggie Boyle (whistle, bodhran, background vocals); Mitch Greenhill (percussion).\n\n1.
