This is what I use.\nVLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabillities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.\nOne can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.\nQuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.\nMany of movies I encode have embedded subtitles. So far, only VLC player is able to use them correctly.\n\nUSE TORRENT-SEARCH SITES, TorrentBar extension for FireFox OR EVEN GOOGLE: show-name H264\n(for example GOSSIP GIRL H264).\n\n&quot;Home&quot; of my torrents (for Bookmark/Favorites in your browser) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty&lt;/a&gt;\n\nInteresting &quot;Discussion&quot; to follow: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5191311/Cloudy.With.A.Chance.Of.Meatballs.PROPER.H264&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5191311/Cloudy.With.A.Chance.Of.Meatballs.PROPER.H264&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5190694/The.Bad.Lieutenant.Port.of.Call.New.Orleans.LIMITED.H264&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5190694/The.Bad.Lieutenant.Port.of.Call.New.Orleans.LIMITED.H264&lt;/a&gt;\nYour comments and opinions are welcomed, good and the bad ones.\n\nSchedule:\nTuesday: H.I.M.Y.M, Heroes, G.Girl, TBBT as MP4 H264; ~3.48 MB/minute\nWednesday: Paradox (BBC) as MP4 H264; ~3.48 MB/minute\nThursday: Glee, Crim.

ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the dilemma facing Detective Inspector Rebecca Flint (Tamzin Outhwaite) and astrophysicist Dr Christian King (Emun Elliott) when a series of rogue images transmitted into his laboratory from space, throw them together.\n\nThe fragmented images appear to be of a major incident, but shockingly they suggest it has yet to happen; itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s in the future. Christian, Rebecca and her team, DS Ben Holt (Mark Bonnar) and DC Callum Gada (ChikÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Okonkwo), have just 18 hours to work out the clues and prevent a tragedy.\n\nSource: FoV\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdc087c5b4b63acb486e27956cf18c018097d6f9","amp;dn":"Paradox.Part3%5BBBC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdc087c5b4b63acb486e27956cf18c018097d6f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,192,135,197,180,182,58,203,72,110,39,149,108,241,140,1,128,151,214,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
