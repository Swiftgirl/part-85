The case goes unsolved for     \n    decades and remains a mystery. Enter the present day, detective Lee      \n    Southward (Brian Anthony Fabian) is sent on assignment to infiltrate     \n    an illegal underground fighting tournament and bring in the              \n    organizers. Lee battles his way to the top of the tournaments in         \n    attempts to get closer to the organizers. As Lee draws closer and        \n    begins to piece clues together he is brought back to the case closed     \n    decades ago. However there is a problem: The organizers (led by WWE      \n    superstar Brian &quot;blue meanie&quot; Heffron and Darian Caine) are of the       \n    undead and crave human blood! Lee must fight his way through all the     \n    sex, drugs, and violence of the underground while trying to piece        \n    together evidence with the help of an undercover officer (Cheyenne       \n    King) and find a way to stop the undead!
