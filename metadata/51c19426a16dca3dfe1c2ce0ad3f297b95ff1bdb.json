Daisy Kean, and P.I. Harry Montana team up to take the suspects--and also six ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“red herrings'--on a fabulous Mediterranean cruise, all expenses paid by the late Sir Robert. As they call at Monte Carlo, St. Tropez and Sorrento, the mystery deepens. And the unexpected twists are just the beginning.\n\nFinally, they arrive at the beautiful Villa Belkiss on Capri, where Sir Robert's will is to be readÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦and the killer unmasked.

The two women are connected, and Mac suddenly finds himself tangled up in a web of deception.

Lately it's been more off than on. But now he needs her more than ever. Together they go on a quest that takes them from Southern California, to the beaches of Mexico, to the streets of Rome, and the countryside of France. All the while they're one step behind an elusive murderer and one step ahead of an actress who wants nothing more than to get lost..\n\nWith Elizabeth Adler's trademark descriptions, plot twists, and irresistible characters, One of Those ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51c19426a16dca3dfe1c2ce0ad3f297b95ff1bdb","amp;dn":"Adler%2C+Elizabeth+-+Sailing+to+Capri","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51c19426a16dca3dfe1c2ce0ad3f297b95ff1bdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,193,148,38,161,109,202,61,254,28,44,224,173,63,41,123,149,255,27,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
