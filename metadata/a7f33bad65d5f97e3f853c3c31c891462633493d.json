The second US single, &quot;Impossible&quot;, was released February 9 2010.\n\nShontelle stated in July 2009 that her second record would be much &quot;edgier&quot; and that there was a &quot;rock chick&quot; waiting to come out of her. She also stated that she wants her fans to hear a new sound from her on this album. Later that month, Shontelle described it as a dance/rock sound. Shontelle's new album is speculated[who?] to be similar to work of the likes of BeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© and Katy Perry. Shontelle stated that most of the details of the album will remain a secret for a while, but it has been confirmed that she is working with Akon and Sean Garrett. Shontelle began recording in August 2009, and stated in January of 2010, that recording had been completed.\n\nOn January 6, 2010, the songs &quot;DJ Made Me Do It&quot; and &quot;Say Hello to Goodbye&quot; were posted on her official myspace. Shontelle has stated that the songs might appear on the album. Although Shontelle originally stated that the album would be an electropop album, she has now stated that it will mainly be an R&amp;B/disco record with a few pop rock and electro-influenced songs.\n\nShontelle Layne (born October 4, 1985), better known by her first name Shontelle, is a singer-songwriter from Barbados.
