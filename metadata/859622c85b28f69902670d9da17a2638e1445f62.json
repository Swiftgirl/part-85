Safe, no ads, pure, non-denominational site.\n\nNow about this upload:\n\nThis short film is a real eye- and heartopener. Explaining the bond and meaning of a rabbi calling disciples. This is really good.\n\nIt's been a while since I've made an upload, and the reason is I've been occupied in the co-work of getting a new site up for all those that hunger and need fellowship in their Christian life, or are interested in finding out what Christianity really is. And I mean true Christianity, not some &quot;DenomiNational&quot; mock-up and blasphemy.\n\nIn there, on that site, the ones with the most stars are the humblest servants, and those who want are given the equal and unique opportunity to tell their story, make bonds, ask for help, post and discuss, download Christian material..\n\nIt's your site for the taking and free use, or borrowing, as we like to look at it, no ratio watch etc. Do you want it? Then go to:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.blazefire.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.blazefire.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou'll be met with the info you need to request an invite, and an invite will come, as soon as someone is awake and get your mail.\n\nAfter a while, the invites will be set to open, but until a good members base is established, we keep it small and safe for all those that's been hurt or otherwise need to find a safe place to grow and be appreciated.\n\nAnd all you have to do to get invited and become a member, is ask. :-)\n\nThe place will remain safe and a good place to be and hang out. That's why this vision of it emerged between myself and some other people I've met through the Internet in the first place.\n\nAnd we have NEVER asked each other what &quot;church&quot; we go to or not. We just have a great fellowship and actually love one another.\n\nYou're welcome to join us..\n\nLove, as always,\n\nVerifire\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:859622c85b28f69902670d9da17a2638e1445f62","amp;dn":"Rob+Bell+-+Dust","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"859622c85b28f69902670d9da17a2638e1445f62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,150,34,200,91,40,246,153,2,103,13,157,161,122,38,56,225,68,95,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
