Good Luck in getting the problem corrected and i think the solution pass for the reeinstall of the redistributables and a correct check of the framework .\n\nCOMMENTS :\n \n- not all the users can experiment this issue using the game but if it happen the suggestion to help is this one\n     \n- the redistributables are necessary to help the stability of some executables running the game\n\n\n* GAMEPLAY :\n\n\n* The player takes the role of &quot;Subject Delta&quot;, a prototype for the Big Daddies seen in the original game and the first Big Daddy to be successfully bonded with a Little Sister. The character possesses superior speed and intelligence to other Big Daddies, as well as free will. As such, the player uses the Big Daddy's drill and rivet gun as weapons as well as some other weapons found across Rapture. However, in a new addition, it is now possible to perform a melee attack with every weapon in the game. The weapons in the game will have several types of ammo, similar to the first game. Additionally, in contrast to other Big Daddies, the player may also use plasmids, while &quot;upgrade trees&quot; will provide unique ways to upgrade them. A new feature added is the ability to dual-wield plasmids or weapons at the same time. Further Big Daddy abilities found in the first game, such as performing a shoulder dash, will also be an option.\n\n \nA Big SisterThe player will also be able to step outside the city of Rapture into the ocean due to the diving suit the Big Daddies wear. Here the player can explore the ocean floor, recover from fights, marvel at the city from the outside and pick up special items. As seen by the demo, some of the special items include first aid kits, EVE Hypos, and special sea slugs. Throughout the game the player will be forced to fight Rapture's new Big Sisters, hybrids of sorts between the Big Daddy and older Little Sisters. A Big Sister attack will be spontaneous and unplanned, but if the player has a Little Sister with them at the time, she'll give you a warning that a Big Sister is coming. Unlike the Big Daddies, they are extremely quick and arguably more powerful, able to extract ADAM from their enemies through a harvesting needle, straight into her bloodstream, which fuels &quot;telekinetic abilities beyond anything previously thought possible&quot;. \n\n[text extracted from wikipedia]\n\n\n\nMinimum System Requirements :\n=============================\n\nOperating System:    Microsoft Windows XP (SP2 or later) / Windows Vista / Windows 7\nProcessor:           AMD Athlon 64 (3800+ 2.4GHz)\n                     Intel Pentium 4 (530 3.0 GHz)\nRAM:                 2 GB\nVideo Card:          NVIDIA 7800GT with 256 MB RAM or better\n                     ATI Radeon X1900 with 256 MB RAM or better\nHard Disc Space:     11 GB\nSound Card:          100% DirectX 9.0c compliant card\n\n\n\n\n                     **** enjoy ... *****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9150f2a16fd208c32f463f665fa70bc33b8b14bb","amp;dn":"PC+%C3%82%C2%BB+BIOSHOCK+2+-+Sea+Of+Dreams+Full+Game+directplay+by+globe%40","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9150f2a16fd208c32f463f665fa70bc33b8b14bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,80,242,161,111,210,8,195,47,70,63,102,95,167,11,195,59,139,20,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
