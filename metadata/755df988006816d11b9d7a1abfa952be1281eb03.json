Considered one of the most controversial scholars of our time, Melville Herskovits ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a Jewish anthropologist ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ challenged the norm in the 1940s when he wrote that black culture wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t pathological, it was African. Leading a seismic shift in the way African American culture is understood, HerskovitsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s work raises ideas that still challenge us today.\n\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:755df988006816d11b9d7a1abfa952be1281eb03","amp;dn":"HERSKOVITS+AT+THE+HEART+OF+BLACKNESS-Independent+Lens-PBS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"755df988006816d11b9d7a1abfa952be1281eb03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,93,249,136,0,104,22,209,27,157,122,26,191,169,82,190,18,129,235,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
