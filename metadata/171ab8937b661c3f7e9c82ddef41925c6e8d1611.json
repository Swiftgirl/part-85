A firewall protects your computer against \nunwanted guests from the Internet. But who protects \nyour private data from being sent out? Little Snitch does! \nAs soon as you're connected to the Internet, applications \ncan potentially send whatever information they want to \nwherever they want.\nSometimes they do this for good reason, on your explicit \nrequest. But often they don't. Little Snitch allows you to \nintercept these unwanted connection attempts, and lets \nyou decide how to proceed.\nLittle Snitch informs you whenever a program attempts to \nestablish an outgoing Internet connection. You can then \nchoose to allow or deny this connection, or define a rule \nhow to handle similar, future connection attempts. This \nreliably prevents private data from being sent out without \nyour knowledge. Little Snitch runs inconspicuously in the \nbackground and it can also detect network related \nactivity of viruses, trojans and other malware.\n\nWhat's New?\n--&gt; New rules can now be created by dragging an \napplication icon into the rules window.\n--&gt; Added a new &quot;Turn into Global Rule&quot; command to \ncontextual menu.\n--&gt; Improved alert message when attempting to delete a \nprotected rule.\n--&gt; Improved detection of invalid process paths.\n--&gt; Added &quot;via&quot; info to summary of &quot;Don't show in \nNetwork Monitor&quot; rules.\n--&gt; The &quot;Buy&quot; button is now removed after successful \nregistration.\n--&gt; Fixed: Clicking in the application column didn't \nselect all rules of this process.\n--&gt; Fixed: Changing a rule's &quot;approved&quot; status didn't \nimmediately update the status icon.\n--&gt; Fixed: Long hangs after accepting / editing rules.\n\nInstallation:\n--&gt; Open folder &amp; unzip file\n--&gt; Mount dmg &amp; install app\n--&gt; Use serial from .txt file to register progam\n--&gt; Done!\n\nENJOY!! \n--&gt; IsolatedSoul5591","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:171ab8937b661c3f7e9c82ddef41925c6e8d1611","amp;dn":"Little+Snitch+v2.2.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"171ab8937b661c3f7e9c82ddef41925c6e8d1611","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,26,184,147,123,102,28,63,126,156,130,221,239,65,146,92,110,141,22,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
