Mp3! \n\nI have included a few links to freeware programs that can be used with ease to convert the music to the mp3 file extension. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.foobar2000.org/download&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.foobar2000.org/download&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.free-codecs.com/Lame_Encoder_download.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.free-codecs.com/Lame_Encoder_download.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you use this first one - &quot;Foobar2000&quot; - you will need to have the LAME mp3 encoder, (the second link provided), if you don't already have it installed.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.mediaconverter.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.mediaconverter.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis one makes the process extremely simple by doing it all online for you, but takes a bit longer and is a bit more tedious having to do them all one at a time and re-download them.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.afterdawn.com/software/audio_video/convert_video/super.cfm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.afterdawn.com/software/audio_video/convert_video/super.cfm&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTo be honest, I am not too familiar with this program. It is free and said to be simple to use for converting flac to mp3. \n\n___________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you have any trouble with anything feel free to comment!
