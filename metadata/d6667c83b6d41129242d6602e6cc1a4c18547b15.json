This is what I use.\nVLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.\nOne can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.\nQuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.\nPS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.\nAnd please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).Many of movies I encode have embedded subtitles.
