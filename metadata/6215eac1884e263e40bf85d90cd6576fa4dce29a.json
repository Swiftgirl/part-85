Requires SetupS.\n\nDescription: Syberia II continues the adventures of American lawyer Kate Walker from the first game as she abandons her increasingly stressful life in New York in order to accompany an eccentric inventor to a remote land in Russia known as Syberia where surviving remnants of prehistoric mammoths still live.\n\nSyberia II, like its predecessor, is a third-person, mouse-driven, semi-realistic/semi-surrealistic adventure game in which the player must solve various puzzles and follow certain procedures in order for the linear storyline to proceed. Stylistically identical to the first Syberia, Syberia II improves upon the first game by introducing more realistic character animation. The game includes a recap of the first chapter, so therefore does not require the player to have experienced the first game.\n\nAs a pure graphical adventure game, Syberia II follows the guidelines first introduced by LucasArts: it is impossible to die or to get stuck at any moment in the game, which allows the user to fully immerse him/herself in Syberia's universe without the fear of making a mistake or the constant need of saving the game.\n\nMD5: 07b1000d01e78d79f2264b5082bc959e\n______________________________________________________________________\n\n'Built on LT technology' ...
