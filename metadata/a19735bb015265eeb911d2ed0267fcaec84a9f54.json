Sound does exist as electromagnetic vibrations. The specially designed instruments on board the various space probes used Plasma Wave antenna to record the vibrations used here, all within the range of human hearing (20-20,000 CPS)\n\nEach planet, moon and ring system has a distinctive &quot;musical&quot; pattern. Listening to this unusual recording has a mysteriously relaxing effect. After a long hard day, you can bring your brainwaves into a slower and meditative state.\n\nIn 1989, Dr. Jeffrey D. Thompson, D.C., B.F.A. was approached by representatives working with NASA and JPL to explore a series of powerful recordings which the Voyager I &amp; II Spacecraft had sent back from Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. These recordings seemed to be having a profound effect on the scientists and researchers who were exposed to them. Dr. Thompson was approached as an expert in the field of sound and healing, and especially in his work with &quot;Primordial Sounds.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Primordial sounds are human body sounds and nature sounds formatted in special ways to cause a deep response in the subconscious mind. These are extremely useful in all levels of healing. Could the space sounds actually be Primordial Sounds, also ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ from outer space but strangely familiar to us?\n\nMiranda is the smallest moon of Uranus and is marked by strange crevasses and canyons. It's largest canyon feature is the size of North America and has canyon walls 9 miles deep.\n\nThere is a theory that this satellite of Uranus was torn apart by the gravitational force of Uranus at least 9 times and then reformed. This could account for the very strange terrain. Miranda is a long time favorite Space Sound recording. It has very deep rhythmic base sounds. You can feel the full moon effect. Sounds like strange winds and occasionally it sounds like choirs and voices singing, which gives Miranda a magical quality.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a19735bb015265eeb911d2ed0267fcaec84a9f54","amp;dn":"NASA+-+Voyager+Recording+-+Miranda+%28Uranus%5C%27+smallest+moon%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a19735bb015265eeb911d2ed0267fcaec84a9f54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,151,53,187,1,82,101,238,185,17,210,237,2,103,252,174,200,74,159,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
