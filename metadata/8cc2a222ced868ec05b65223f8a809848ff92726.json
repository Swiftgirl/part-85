But Oetsch stays; arguing he is not the murderer and will find the real one..\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cc2a222ced868ec05b65223f8a809848ff92726","amp;dn":"Schloss+Vogeloed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cc2a222ced868ec05b65223f8a809848ff92726","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,194,162,34,206,216,104,236,5,182,82,35,248,168,9,132,143,249,39,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
