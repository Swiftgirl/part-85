Shankly's music collection for the first month of the New Year begins by recognising the Dandelion Radio Festive Fifty as the yardstick that all good music should be measured by. Shankly's collection of these fifty tracks is incomplete and he would be happy to hear from anyone who could help add to it. \n\nThe next 4 CDs worth of tracks are the best of the rest of 2009. These are tracks that came to the ears of Shankly too late to be part of the 2009 compilations, but are included here as songs that no one should have to live without. \n\nAfter this you will finally get to the best songs that Janaury hs had to offer us. The usual 4 CDs worth of music is included here with the usual array of cover versions, new singles, new album tracks, remixes and a few live recordings and rarities to boot. \n\nEnjoy! \n\n\nJanuary\nDandelion Radio Festive fifty 2009 Tracks\n1.\tLos Campesinos - There are Listed Buildings (#1)\n2.\tPains of Being Pure At Heart - Young Adult Friction (#2)\n3.\tAnimal Collective - My Girls (#3)\n4.\tFuck Buttons - Surf Solar (#4)\n5.\tChasms - Advance Paranoia Advance (#5)\n6.\tNightingales - I Am Grimaldi (#6)\n7.\tJoy Formidable ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Whirring (#7)\n8.\tLos Campesinos - The Sea Is A Good Place To Think O The Future (#9)\n9.\tDizzee Rascal and Armand van Helden ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Bonkers (#11)\n10.\tCamera Obscura - French Navy (#12)\n11.\tCrystal Stilts - Love Is A Wave (#15)\n12.\tGrizzly Bear - Two Weeks (#17)\n13.\tPJ Harvey &amp; John Parish - Black Hearted Love (#18)\n14.\tSuper Furry Animals - Cardiff In The Sun (#21)\n15.\tAllo Darlin - Henry Rollins Don't Dance (#22)\n16.\tJoy Formidable - The Greatest Light Is The Greatest Shade (#23)\n17.\tQwel &amp; Jackson Jones - The CD Exchange (#24)\n18.\tPains of Being Pure At Heart - Higher Than The Stars (#25)\n19.\tBat for Lashes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Daniel (#27)\n20.\tSky Larkin ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Matador (#29)\n21.\tHealth - Die-Slow (#30)\n22.\tFlorence &amp; The Machine - Drumming Song (#31)\n23.\tAnimal Collective - Brother Sport (#32)\n24.\tMumford and Sons - Little Lion Man (#33)\n25.\tCamera Obscura - My Maudlin Career (#34)\n26.\tFuck Buttons - Space Mountain (#35)\n27.\tArt Brut - Demons Out!
