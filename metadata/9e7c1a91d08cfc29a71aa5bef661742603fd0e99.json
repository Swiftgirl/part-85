Documentary of Mass Effect 2 (SCI VS FI)\n\n\tDivided into 4 parts.\n\n2-. The Trailers\n\n\tThe complete amazing CGI trailer is here as well as the final launch trailer.\n\n3-. The Main Characters of the game\n\n\tThe main characters of Mass Effect 2 explain in front of the camera why they chose to join Shepard. Amazing CGI in some of them, specially the face animation of Subject Zero.\nThe characters explained are:\n\n\t-Tali\n\t-Samara\n\t-Thane\n\t-Subject Zero\n\t-Grunt\n\t-Commander Shepard\n\t-Miranda\n\t-Zaaeed\n\t-Mordin\t\n\n4-. The 6 Classes of Mass Effect 2\n\n\tAll the 6 classes of the game explained by Christina Norman lead designer of Mass Effect 2. The classes explained are:\n\t\n\t-Infiltrator\n\t-Vanguard\n\t-Soldier\n\t-Sentinel\n\t-Engineer\n\t-Adept\n\n5-. The Making of Mass Effect 2\n\n\tTwo videos included here: The Stars of Mass Effect 2 and Development diaries.\n\n\n\nAll this videos are available everywhere but I wanted to create a DVD video to compile them all into a single disk so with the pass of time I could remember all this information easily. This DVD is also my personal tribute to Bioware for creating such an impressive universe that mantains captivating me since I first played Mass Effect.\nI hope this DVD gives tempts you to buy the game and join the Mass Effect community. \n\nBe patient while I'm seeding this...my DSL speed connection sucks big time and its been ages since I upload something in TPB. So any suggestion to helme me improve seeding is welcome. Thanks. \nI used RAT DVD to compress the almost 4 Gb iso file.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e7c1a91d08cfc29a71aa5bef661742603fd0e99","amp;dn":"PC+Game+Trailers%3A+Mass+Effect+2.+The++Classified+Cerberus+Archiv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e7c1a91d08cfc29a71aa5bef661742603fd0e99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,124,26,145,208,140,252,41,167,26,165,190,246,97,116,38,3,253,14,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
