This one had no previews to remove so I left everything as is. Has all the menus and special features. The only thing I did was to compress it to fit a dvd5. The movie was only 5.2GB from the store to begin with. \n\n\nThe second folder has the &quot;Something Something Something Darkside&quot; which had a shitload of previews that I removed and some of the logos. The disk was also compressed to fit a dvd5.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9953a1a9926ede34dab8a0f9c11a9642853d5041","amp;dn":"Family+Guy+Star+Wars+Episodes.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9953a1a9926ede34dab8a0f9c11a9642853d5041","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,83,161,169,146,110,222,52,218,184,160,249,193,26,150,66,133,61,80,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
