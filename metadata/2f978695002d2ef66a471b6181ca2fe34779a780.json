It is a ballad combining elements of pop and gospel, but Carey had originally conceived it as a house record with David Morales titled &quot;Fly Away (Butterfly Reprise)&quot;. After realizing how personal the lyrics were and how they could be applied to Butterfly, she wrote &quot;Butterfly&quot; with Afanasieff. On the song's lyrics, Carey comments &quot;It was '97 and I was leaving my marriage [to Tommy Mottola] which encompassed my life. I was writing the song 'Butterfly' wishing that that's what he would say to me.&quot;\n\nIt was released as the album's second single in 1997. It did not appear on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart because it was not issued as a commercial single in the United States; Billboard magazine rules at the time stipulated that a commercial release was required for a song to enter the Hot 100. It was a moderate success on charts that airplay-only singles were allowed to enter, such as the Rhythmic Airplay Chart, Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks and Top 40 Mainstream charts, and it reached number 7 on Billboard's Hot 100 Airplay chart. &quot;Butterfly&quot; was not a substantial hit outside the U.S.: it reached number 22 in the UK and number 27 in Australia, failing to match the success of &quot;Honey&quot;, the album's first single. In France and Germany the single did not reach the top forty.\n\n&quot;Butterfly&quot; was nominated for the 1998 Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, which it lost to Sarah McLachlan's &quot;Building a Mystery&quot;.\n\nThe single's music video was co-directed by Carey and Daniel Pearl. It is inspired by the Tennessee Williams play Baby Doll and a dream of Carey's. It starts with a man leaving a house with Carey inside, and Carey is then seen wandering through a forest with horses.\n\nDavid Morales created several dance remixes of the song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ in addition to the original version of &quot;Butterfly&quot;, which is known as &quot;Fly Away (Butterfly Reprise)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ among them the &quot;Fly Away&quot; club mix (an extended version of &quot;Fly Away (Butterfly Reprise)&quot;) and Def 'B' Fly mix (a variation of the &quot;Fly Away&quot; club mix with completely re-sung vocals of the original &quot;Butterfly&quot;). &quot;Fly Away (Butterfly Reprise)&quot; reached the top twenty on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart, and a shortened version is included as an interlude on the album Butterfly. Latin remixes of &quot;Butterfly&quot;, influenced by the musical styles of flamenco and salsa, were also commissioned by Meme. They include &quot;Butterfly&quot; (Sambatterfly), &quot;Butterfly&quot; (Classic Bossa Nova), and &quot;Butterfly&quot; (Meme's extended club mix part.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f978695002d2ef66a471b6181ca2fe34779a780","amp;dn":"Mariah+Carey+-+Butterfly++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f978695002d2ef66a471b6181ca2fe34779a780","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,151,134,149,0,45,46,246,106,71,27,97,129,202,47,227,71,121,167,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
