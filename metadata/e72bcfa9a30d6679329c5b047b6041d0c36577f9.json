Democrats looking for some economic populism windowdressing in the wake of the GOP victory in the MA Senate race. Bernanke's reappointment not looking so secure now. Obama might fire Geithner to achieve a similar symbolism.\n\nHour 1 ends with an update on the Icelandic debt situation.\n\nHour 2 begins with an appearance by Phil Berg, still persuing the Obama birth certification issue.\n\nLater in the second hour, Webster talks about the public's attaction to populism during a depression, and expounds on the important differences between economic populism [real] and cultural populism [fake].\n\n\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
