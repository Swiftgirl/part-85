Find out how technology changed\n      warfare forever, before seeing Chris climb into the cockpit for\n      an exhilarating flight on the first aircraft to fly across the\n      Atlantic.\n      \n     \n                                                      Group Notes...\n                                                      \n      Affil sites, NO COLO/RENTED and NO .US!                       \n                                                                     \n      Retail TV dvds before the retail date.                        \n                                                                     \n      If you're a P2P retard don't even bother emailing us, because \n       we WILL hurl abuse at you.
