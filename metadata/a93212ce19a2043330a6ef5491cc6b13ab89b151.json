Did you catch Sarah PalinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s debut as a standup comedian on the Tonight Show last night? Usually a comedian has to work for years to get a slot on the Tonight Show. Sarah Palin did it with absolutely no prior work, experience, or dues payingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ kind of like the way she wanted to become Vice President.   If it sounds like something of a stretch for Sarah, keep in mind that itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not that much of a jump to start telling jokes after youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve spent the past couple of years being a joke. Obviously these jokes werenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t written by Sarah Palin. You could tell because they didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t go on for 15 stream-of-consciousness minutes punctuated with an occasional ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œperhaps soÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œyou betcha.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ HereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a little advice, SarahÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re a lot funnier when youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re not trying to be. All in all, it wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t nearly as funny as your interview with Katie Couric. Who wrote that one for you, Sarah? Because theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re a genius. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPutin rears his head?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Classic! And that bit where you try to come up with the name of a Supreme Court case while youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re making all those wacky faces? I still laugh every time I see it. Oh, and I also liked you better when you were doing prop comedy. Bring back the guy behind you slaughtering turkeys. Finally, your delivery wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t all that good. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve seen better timing from Jim Bunning. Speaking of whichÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.\n\nThose wacky Republicans! The Jim Bunning hostage standoff is over!  Finally! They had to do everything this side of trying to talk Jim Bunning down with a megaphone. At least we got this resolved before Jim Bunning handcuffed himself to the podium at the floor of the Senate. This is a guy who once pitched a perfect gameÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½one of the greatest feats possible in baseball, and now heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just going to be remembered as the nutty old guy who didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t like unemployed people. It would be like bowling a perfect 300 game, then going outside the bowling alley and kicking a dog in the parking lot. But give Jim Bunning creditÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½he made his point. Unfortunately, that point was that Jim Bunning is a crazy old coot. Well, now heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s free to go home, look out the front window, and yell at people who park in front of his house. Jim Bunning will be retiring after this term. But he will not go gently into that good night. In fact, he seems to be doing his damned best to make that good night a very bad night for everybody else. Thank God we have funny people like Sarah Palin to take our minds off such things.
