It is using TripleDES\nas a cryptographic algorithm. This is\na block encryption algorithm with a\nsymmetric key, i.e. one key is used\nfor both encryption and decryption of\ndata.\n\nEasy Crypter 2010 provides reliable\ndata protection from unauthorized\naccess. The encryption algorithm used\nin the program resists all possible\ntypes of break-in: despite decades of\nresearchers efforts, effective\nattacks on it were not found. It can\nbe used either by organizations to\nprotect trade secrets, or by\nindividuals to store personal\ninformation in secrecy.\n\nURL: http://www.easycrypter.com\n\niNSTALL NOTES\n\n1.)
