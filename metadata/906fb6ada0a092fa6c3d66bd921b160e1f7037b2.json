Sticky Password     \n              links passwords and accounts to applications and    \n              websites for which they are used. All information   \n              is stored in encrypted form in the Database,        \n              access to which is protected by a Master            \n              Password. Personal data is easily accessible if     \n              the Database is unlocked. After launching a         \n              website or application, Sticky Password             \n              automatically enters the password, user name and    \n              other personal data. Thus, you need not remember    \n              all the passwords, you only need to remember one    \n              password.                                           \n                                                                  \n              By default, Sticky Password loads automatically     \n              when the operating system starts up. This           \n              component is built in into the application which    \n              allows personal data to be managed directly from    \n              the application window.                             \n                                                                  \n              Sticky Password monitors the actions of             \n              applications with passwords and prevents the        \n              interception and theft of personal data. This       \n              component checks applications that use passwords    \n              or request them from other applications, before     \n              asking you to allow or forbid a suspicious action.  \n\n             &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.stickypassword.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.stickypassword.com/&lt;/a&gt;                      \n\n\n                                            \n                   \n                               \n                                     \n                            \n                           \n                               \n              \n   \n\n\n              Unpack, Install.                                    \n              Copy cracked files from /iNViSiBLE dir to app dir.  \n              Enjoy!                                              \n              If you like this app, BUY iT!                       \n\n\n                                              \n                                       \n                                                \n                                   \n                         \n                                \n                                  \n                           \n        \n             \n\n              Experienced reversers, coders and suppliers wanted.\n\n\n                                            \n                                iNViSiBLE                      \n                               2k9                             \n                                     \n                                 \n                                \n                                   \n                                       \n                                      \n                                         \n                          \n                    \n                       \n                                                     \n                                                             \n                        aSCii by yool, diRECT FroM sTARS!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:906fb6ada0a092fa6c3d66bd921b160e1f7037b2","amp;dn":"Sticky.Password.v4.0.0.142-iNViSiBLE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"906fb6ada0a092fa6c3d66bd921b160e1f7037b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,111,182,173,160,160,146,250,108,61,102,189,146,27,22,14,31,112,55,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
