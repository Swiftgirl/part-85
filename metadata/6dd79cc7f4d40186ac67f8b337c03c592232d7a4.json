Anyway, for some reason, everyone was stuck at 99.8%, and the files on my computer had somehow changed, so I couldn't seed everyone the last two pieces.  So here's a new torrent of the same thing, but this one works.  The tracks are 256kbps, and were originally downloaded from iTunes.  Sorry for the inconvenience of having another torrent, and I hope that having the whole album this time will make up for it.  Thanks, and I hope you enjoy the music.  Also, please help me seed, because my computer isn't always on, and I'd like this torrent to stay alive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dd79cc7f4d40186ac67f8b337c03c592232d7a4","amp;dn":"Tim+Janis+-+Water%5C%27s+Edge+%28this+one+works%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dd79cc7f4d40186ac67f8b337c03c592232d7a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,215,156,199,244,212,1,134,172,103,248,179,55,192,60,89,34,50,215,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
