O&amp;O DiskImage Server Edition takes this once step further by providing features that make your job as an Administrator significantly easier. Among these features are the network support made possible by O&amp;O Enterprise Management Console and the new Job Assistant for time-scheduling a variety of jobs. Remote installation and creating images within a network can now be done directly from your workstation. What's more, forensic imaging for purposes of data recovery and the Start CD (which can be used even under defective Windows systems) are often the very last hope for your companyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s data when trouble strikes.\n\nHighlights\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ M.I.R.
