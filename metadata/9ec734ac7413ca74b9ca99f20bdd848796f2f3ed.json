How brief? Well, that depends on you. You play a frantic man fleeing the destruction of his city by giant robots. You control him as he hurdles across buildings, leaps over gaps and obstacles, and tries to stay one step ahead of the mayhem. This, of course, would be much easier if people would stop leaving office chairs in his path. And dropping bombs. And destroying buildings beneath him. His reward? High score, baby!\n\nGame has good music and simple yet addicting gameplay.\n\n_/  /_ _  _ _ _ _ \n/(/((///)(// / (- \n /                \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ec734ac7413ca74b9ca99f20bdd848796f2f3ed","amp;dn":"Canabalt.ipa+Ipod+touch+app","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ec734ac7413ca74b9ca99f20bdd848796f2f3ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,199,52,172,116,19,202,116,185,202,153,242,11,221,132,135,150,242,243,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
