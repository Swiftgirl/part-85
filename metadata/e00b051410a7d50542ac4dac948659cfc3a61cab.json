Founded on December 4, 1998, Warehouse gives fan early access to concert tickets, exclusive CDs and merchandise to its members.\n\nStarting in 1999, Warehouse club members received an annual gift package. Membership packages are mailed to members that joined or renewed in that year. After the original package in 1999, all membership packages included an exclusive Warehouse CD. All of these CDs, except for one ***(see 2001)***, are Warehouse 5 volumes and contain five live tracks from various tours. In 2003, the first Warehouse 8 volume [coming soon to TPB] was released and distributed to those who had been members for three years or more. The Warehouse 8 releases have three additional tracks.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nThe Warehouse 5 [Vol. 1] [2000]\n\n   1. &quot;Crush&quot; (12.07.1998 - Centrum Centre - Worcester, MA)\n          * featuring Butch Taylor\n   2. &quot;Warehouse&quot; (12.03.1998 - Madison Square Garden - New York, NY)\n          * featuring Butch Taylor\n   3. &quot;#41&quot; (12.08.1998 - Centrum Centre - Worcester, MA)\n          * featuring Butch Taylor, BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©la Fleck, and Jeff Coffin\n   4. &quot;Say Goodbye&quot; (12.10.1998 - The Palace of Auburn Hills - Auburn Hills, MI)\n   5. &quot;Two Step&quot; (12.11.1998 - Kohl Center)\n\n(All songs feature Tim Reynolds)\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nThe Warehouse 5 [Vol. 2] [2002]\n\n   1. &quot;The Stone&quot; (07.27.2001 - Virginia Beach Amphitheater - Virginia Beach, VA)\n   2. &quot;When the World Ends&quot; (07.06.2001 - Soldier Field - Chicago, IL)\n   3. &quot;Seek Up&quot; (07.30.2001 - Saratoga Performing Arts Center)\n   4. &quot;Grace Is Gone&quot; (07.07.2001 - Soldier Field - Chicago, IL)\n   5. &quot;Grey Street&quot; (07.07.2001 - Soldier Field - Chicago, IL)\n\n(All songs feature Butch Taylor)\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nThe Warehouse 5 [Vol. 3] [2003]\n\n   1. &quot;Minarets&quot; (08.29.2000 - Saratoga Performing Arts Center)\n          * featuring Butch Taylor\n   2. &quot;Recently&quot; (07.13.1999 - ARCO Arena - Sacramento, CA)\n   3. &quot;Let You Down&quot; (12.08.1996 - Charleston Civic Center Coliseum)\n   4. &quot;Typical Situation&quot; (07.16.1999 - The Gorge Amphitheatre - George, WA)\n   5. &quot;Halloween&quot; (12.21.2002 - Madison Square Garden - New York, NY)\n          * featuring Butch Taylor\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***2001***\n\nThis package featured an enhanced CD, a poster, and a Warehouse Fan Club bumper sticker.
