Thrill Kill was considered a technical feat for the PlayStation for allowing four players to fight simultaneously in the same room, although this technical feat was overshadowed by the brutality and controversy surrounding the game. Set in an urban version of Hell, the characters were all damned souls fighting for another chance in the mortal world, watched over by Marukka the Goddess of Secrets, who has organized the infernal tournament and promised the winner reincarnation on Earth. Other content included revealing BDSM and fetishistic costumes, characters with amputated limbs and other handicaps and violent and sexual moves with names such as &quot;Bitch Slap&quot;, &quot;Swallow This&quot;, and &quot;RUG Muncher&quot;.]\n\nPLEASE SEED!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c7268ee452d8e0b987a68fc368288ea56230321","amp;dn":"Thrill+Kill-+PSP-PSX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c7268ee452d8e0b987a68fc368288ea56230321","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,114,104,238,69,45,142,11,152,122,104,252,54,130,136,234,86,35,3,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
