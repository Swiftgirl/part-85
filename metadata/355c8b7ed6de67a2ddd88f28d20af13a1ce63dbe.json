Actually the debateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been longer than that, depending on when you say it started. You could easily say it started during the Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt. So, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s somewhere between 7 and a half hours and a century. In any case, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been a long, long time. Yesterday was like a marathonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ except that a marathon has an eventual end, and the Republicans want an event in which nobody ever crosses the finish line. All of the Republicans were hiding behind printed-out stacks of the Democratic plan. What does it say for your plan, when your only plan is to show up with the other guyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s plan? That was a metaphor for what was happening. By mocking the DemocratsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ plan, they were trying to hide the fact that they had no plan of their own. The Democrats didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t bring any copies of the Republican plan to mock. Oh, maybe thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s because there is no Republican Plan! Maybe the Democrats should have brought a post-it note with the word ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ written on it, and tried to hide behind that.\n\nThe Republicans stuck to their talking points, alrightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½so much so that they werenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t so much talking points as they were chanting points.  ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s almost like the Republicans were brainwashed automatons chanting ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œstart over,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œclean sheet of paper,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œstep by step.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ They were like members of the Red State Army, chanting from the book of Frank Luntz. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStart over!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ America needs answers, and all the Republicans can do is ask for a mulligan. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStart from a clean sheet of paper!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Odd, as far as I can tell, the Republican plan IS a clean sheet of paper. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStep by step!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Yes, the Republicans want to go ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œstep by stepÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ on healthcareÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ right off of a cliff. Finally, Republicans kept demanding that President Obama renounce the possibility of using reconciliation to pass healthcare reform. TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re basically saying ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWe wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t let you do it with us. Now promise you wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t do it without us.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:355c8b7ed6de67a2ddd88f28d20af13a1ce63dbe","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+Feb+26+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"355c8b7ed6de67a2ddd88f28d20af13a1ce63dbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,92,139,126,214,222,103,162,221,216,143,40,210,10,241,58,28,230,61,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
