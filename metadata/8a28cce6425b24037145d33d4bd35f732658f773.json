Too Many Chances [2:55]\n\n\nMy musical education started at the feet of Sonny Terry and Brownie Mcgee at my gradeschool in 1956. My style runs through Delta, Piedmont, Rags, Ballads and Folk Blues. I listen to the recordings of the best players and steal licks and morph them into my own tunes and versions of acoustic blues classics. I have performed and taught at the PORT TOWNSEND BLUES FEST, and travel the US playing solid solo acoustic country blues. ~TDC\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a28cce6425b24037145d33d4bd35f732658f773","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Thomas+David+Corlett+-+Backroad+Blues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a28cce6425b24037145d33d4bd35f732658f773","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,40,204,230,66,91,36,3,113,69,211,61,75,211,95,115,38,88,247,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
