I was fooling around with the intro and used a new release from a DJ named Maetrik.  It is un-fucking-real!  I've been playing it the last couple weeks and I can't get it out of my head.  There are a couple good remixes of it out there so look to hear it again in one of my future mixes.  I'll also give mention to the Claude Von Stroke track &quot;Vocal Chords&quot;.....amazing track and a bit different then everything that's going around these days.  I love it. \n\nWell that's that!  Hope you enjoy my newest mix and stay tuned for more.  I'm already working on House Mix IX and expecting it to be completed by mid to end of March.  See you then!  Go Canada Go!\n\n\nCheers,\n\nn.a.K.\n\nYou can check out all my house mixes at musicthroughscience d0t com\n\n\nTrack Listing \n\nIntro ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Fitter Happier.....Treefingers\nMaetrik - Paradigm House (Original Mix)                                                                         \n360, Nuno Dos Santos &amp; Patrice Baumel - Neon One (Original Mix)                     \nKid Dub &amp; Dextress - Perverted Ways (Miles Dyson's Dominatrix Mix)           \nSaeed Younan - Yeah Ha (Original Mix)                                                                           \nEDX - Premiumline (Original Mix)                                                                               \nClaude VonStroke - Vocal Chords (Original Mix)                                                   \nDepeche Mode - Hole To Feed (Popof Vocal Mix)                                                        \nBuy Now - For Sale (Sebastian Ingrosso &amp; Steve Angello Mix)                         \nEDX - Party of Politics (Original Club Mix)                                                               \nDJ Chus &amp; Rob Mirage - Back 2 NY (Original Mix)                                                  \nMarc Adamo &amp; Tim Healey - Ghetto Blaster (Calvertron Remix)                     \nPaul Thomas - Sunrise (Hy2rogen &amp; Fr3cky Remix)                                             \nDeadmau5 &amp; Chris Lake - I Said (Michael Woods Remix)                                    \nPitto - Feelin' (Original Mix)                                                                                              \n\n\nTotal Track Time\n1:19:55 \n                                                                                                                                                                                     \nTrack Info\n320kbps MP3\n44100Hz\nStereo\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b2f36d9ce38d82a158d09a3e9cd43b6c90f7d57","amp;dn":"n.a.K.+House+Mix+VIII+-+A+Radiohead+House+Mix+%28XXV-II-MMX%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b2f36d9ce38d82a158d09a3e9cd43b6c90f7d57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,47,54,217,206,56,216,42,21,141,9,163,233,205,67,182,201,15,125,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
