While milestone 1 introduced various pre-release versions of free and open source projects (KDE 4.4 RC1, OpenOffice 3.2 Beta4 or VirtualBox 3.1 beta 1) into our development distribution openSUSE Factory, this milestone is characterized by final releases of those projects. We are also preparing everything to switch to GCC 4.5.0 as the default compiler. Currently our staging version of Factory already builds with it and our compiler people document/fix the most serious issues. They aim at milestone 3 for the switch.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ba3f1f0387d54dcf26a41edbeb3bea6a83182b0","amp;dn":"openSUSE-GNOME-LiveCD-Build0447-x86_64","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ba3f1f0387d54dcf26a41edbeb3bea6a83182b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,163,241,240,56,125,84,220,242,106,65,237,190,179,190,166,168,49,130,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
