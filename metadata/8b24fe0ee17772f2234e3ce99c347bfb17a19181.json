Lessons of life, love, and letdowns have propelled Bronsen to carry out some of his most heartfelt and passionate material to date. Since the early days of his collaborative works in music to his solitary adventures in poignant lyricism, the man has shown the intricacies of the human emotion and spilled himself dry for respective listeners to digest his rhetoric and reasoning in more ways than one. Wit incurs that not only does he produce musical and lyrical landscapes for listeners to enjoy, but is commended for his proficiency in self producing his own work. Recorded entirely at his home in Las Vegas, Bronsen continues to create indie works of art that in turn plays an equal inspiration toward oncoming material for both he and others around him. As of 2008, Bronsen has a 9 track EP (titled The HomeComp EP) and a full length 12 track LP (titled Audio Luminescence: Songs of Love and Loss) under his belt and continues to polish audio gems that will one day manifest into devoted pieces of his life and understanding. Bronsen continues to write and hopes to put out new audio tracks within the next year! Bronsen is from Honolulu, Hawaii and now resides in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\n\nThe current lineup of Built In Silence, including drummer Joel Stanizewski, started playing together in spring 2009.
