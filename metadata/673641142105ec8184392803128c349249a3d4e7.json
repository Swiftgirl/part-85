Sheriff Eben Oleson and Deputy Billy Kitka find many cell phones burned on the road. Then they receive a phone call from the local creator telling that his dogs have been slaughtered; later Eben finds the operator of the cell tower decapitated. He arrests a troublemaker drifter and the stranger frightens him telling that &quot;they are coming and the locals will be dead&quot;. Sooner Eben discovers that the town is under siege and attacked by a gang of bloodthirsty vampires, and together with a few survivors, they hide in a empty cellar expecting for the next sunrise.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:673641142105ec8184392803128c349249a3d4e7","amp;dn":"30+Days+Of+Night+%28Custom+DVD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"673641142105ec8184392803128c349249a3d4e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,54,65,20,33,5,236,129,132,57,40,3,18,140,52,146,73,163,212,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
