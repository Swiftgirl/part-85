Meanwhile Eric discovers and \n\nenjoys that the one thing hotter then make up-sex is going away-sex, so anything with Donna anywhere is \n\na '(maybe) our last time' excuse. \n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSeason 6, Episode 3: Magic Bus\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½12 November 2003\nIt's Donna's last night in Point Place, and it's also Eric's eighteenth birthday.

Just admitting he finds Brooke hot too gets Hyde in Jackie's bad books, but he's not about \n\nto lie for her; Kitty assures her it just takes a few years of picking shrewd shrew-battles till a man \n\njust gives up 'disobeying'. Donna tells Kelso that Brooke is now a librarian, he keeps insisting -the \n\nother boys only now discover there is a library in town, and it has many Playboys!

Donna is furious when she \n\nlearns Eric hangs out there and is now popular with a few schoolgirls, so she turns up during her radio \n\nshow. Fez fears the football team will again lock him up in a locker.
