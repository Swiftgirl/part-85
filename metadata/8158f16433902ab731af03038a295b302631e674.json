Rogers Wireless and Clear Channel have a lot to do with the current music scene as there radio stations are ruining it with narrow demographics and playlisting to the point of extinguishing the vital spark that is pop music.\n\nCheryl Cole came to light in a UK TV Talent show, joined Girls Aloud and this solo effort went on to be the 4th biggest hit in the whole of 2009 in the UK and number one all over Europe.\n\nClass Pop and Dance, just download it and listen.  Then write to your local radio station and ask them why the heck they did not play it sigh....\n\nSource DVD logo free\nWidescreen 16:9 Ratio\nAudio 320Kbps Stereo\nVideo VOB (mpeg2) original DVD quality un edited","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8158f16433902ab731af03038a295b302631e674","amp;dn":"Cheryl+Cole+-+Fight+For+This+Love+%5BVideo%5D.VOB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8158f16433902ab731af03038a295b302631e674","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,88,241,100,51,144,42,183,49,175,3,3,138,41,91,48,38,49,230,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
