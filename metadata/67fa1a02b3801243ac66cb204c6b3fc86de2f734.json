She and an entourage arrange to travel to Alaska for a photo shoot, and persuade Charles to accompany them. They all have seemingly forgotten that it is also Charles' birthday, until a surprise party reveals that they had not. A hint of trouble comes when Robert Green (Bob), the fashion photographer, plants a quick, albeit public, kiss on the cheek of his model, Charles' beautiful wife, then she quickly winks affectionately at her onlooking husband, who nonetheless looks troubled by this interaction.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67fa1a02b3801243ac66cb204c6b3fc86de2f734","amp;dn":"The+edge+DVDRip+%281997%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67fa1a02b3801243ac66cb204c6b3fc86de2f734","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,250,26,2,179,128,18,67,172,102,203,32,76,107,63,200,109,226,247,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
