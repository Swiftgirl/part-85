I have edited out the  music played during the commercial breaks.\n\nNOTE: Somebody screwing up at Mercury.  For the first break on each hour they played a commercial over the live show on the web broadcast.  I cut out the bad stuff and returned at the clear part.  You'll hear a scratch to indicate what I'm talking about.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a37f5949496789e5305b20825bd4882e3eef6df4","amp;dn":"Glenn+Beck+2011-04-11+%28Radio+Web+Rip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a37f5949496789e5305b20825bd4882e3eef6df4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,127,89,73,73,103,137,229,48,91,32,130,91,212,136,46,62,239,109,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
