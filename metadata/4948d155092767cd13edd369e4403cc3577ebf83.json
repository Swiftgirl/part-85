They are in divx. They're great, but the title and credits to each are nearly as long as the films. So here they are strung together with only one opening title sequence and one closing credit at the end, totaling 17:40. I have to say that I like The Snoozatron episode the best, Gromit's disgust while dressed as a sheep is smashing. There is a time code problem with the video, it says that it's total running time is 1:10:46, it isn't. Thanks to BPDcarrier for the original dvd rip.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4948d155092767cd13edd369e4403cc3577ebf83","amp;dn":"Wallace+and+Gromit+Cracking+Contraptions+edited","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4948d155092767cd13edd369e4403cc3577ebf83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,72,209,85,9,39,103,205,19,237,211,105,228,64,60,195,87,126,191,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
