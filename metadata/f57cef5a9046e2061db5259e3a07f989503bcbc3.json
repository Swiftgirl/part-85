Erywn's soul has been enclosed in a protective orb by his clairvoyant sister, Aira, and the orb must now be returned to the dungeon where Erwyn is captive, using a magical beam of light. The player must control the beam of light and exploit the state-changing abilities of the orb to fulfil the challenges of the 40 single player levels or 10 multiplayer levels.
