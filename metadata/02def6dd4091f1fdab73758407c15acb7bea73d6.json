What Really Happened is proud to be one of the oldest political blogs on the net.\nRivero runs the WhatReallyHappened radio show on GCN six days a week, and makes good use of his sharp wit to help his blog visitors and radio listeners not only to read/hear the news but to understand what IS really happening. \n\n===============================================================\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02def6dd4091f1fdab73758407c15acb7bea73d6","amp;dn":"What+Really+Happened+-+2010+Feb+12+FR+%5Bsebaygo1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02def6dd4091f1fdab73758407c15acb7bea73d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,222,246,221,64,145,241,253,171,115,117,132,7,193,90,203,123,234,115,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
