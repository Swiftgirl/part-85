Is Us.\n\nAlternate Taglines\n# In 2019, The Most Precious Natural Resource... Is Us.\n\nPlot Outline\nIn the year 2019, a plague has transformed most every human\ninto vampires. Faced with a dwindling blood supply, the\nfractured dominant race plots their survival; meanwhile, a\nresearcher works with a covert band of vamps on a way to\nsave humankind.\n\nPlot\nIn a world 10 years into the future, vampires make up the\nvast majority of the population with only 5% of the human\nrace remaining. This presents particular challenges as the\nvampires' food supply - human blood - is dwindling and\nrationing is now the norm. There is growing evidence that\nvampires deprived of an adequate blood supply are themselves\nevolving into wild, vile creatures that attack anyone and\nanything in order to survive. Dr. Edward Dalton, a vampire\nand hematologist who works for a pharmaceutical firm, has\nbeen working on finding an artificial blood supply that will\nmeet the vampire society's needs. He is sympathetic to\nhumans and sees his work as a way of alleviating their\nsuffering but his views on finding a solution change\nconsiderably when he meets someone who found a way to\ntransform himself from being a vampire to again take human\nform.\n\nMovie Info\nRuntime : 98 minutes\nMPAA Rating : Rated R for strong bloody violence, language and brief\nnudity.\nViewer Rating : 7.0/10\nGenre : Action\nAll Genres : Action, Drama, Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller\n\nDirector/s\nMichael Spierig\nPeter Spierig\n\nProducer/s\nPeter Block - executive producer\nChris Brown - producer\nTodd Fellman - co-producer\nBryan Furst - producer\nSean Furst - producer\nStuart Wood - line producer\n\nCast\nHarriet Minto-Day - Lisa Barrett\nJay Laga'aia - Senator Turner\nDamien Garvey - Senator Westlake\nSahaj Dumpleton - Homeless Vampire\nAllan Todd - Businessman\nGabriella Di Labio - Businesswoman\nBen Siemer - Police Officer\nPeter Welman - Police Officer\nEthan Hawke - Edward Dalton\nCallum McLean - Vampire School Kid\n\n\nDaybreakers (2009)\n\nRelease.Date___: 31/01/2009\nVideo.Format___: 640x272\nAudio.Format___: MP3 2.0 128 kb/s\nSource_________: DVDSCR DVD5\nVideo__________: PAL DVDSCR\nSubtitles______:\niMDB.Rating____: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433362/\niMDB.LiNK______: 7.0/10 6,499 votes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b46b1410458767792c32d34c84202a9df033240","amp;dn":"Daybreakers+%28DVDSCR%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b46b1410458767792c32d34c84202a9df033240","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,70,177,65,4,88,118,119,146,195,45,52,200,66,2,169,223,3,50,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
