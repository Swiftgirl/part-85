They've won multiple Eisners and have worked with the top names of comics and pop culture from Joss Whedon (Sugar Shock) and Mike Mignola (BPRD: 1947) to Gerard Way (Umbrella Academy) and Matt Fraction (Casanova).\n\nNow, Brazilian wonder twins FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡bio Moon and Gabriel BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ are back writing and drawing in a hauntingly lyrical series set in their native Brazil. With DAYTRIPPER, they follow in the tradition of Craig Thompson, Paul Pope and David Mazzucchelli - cartoonists at the top of their game making comics about the quiet moments that ask big questions.\n\nBrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s de Oliva Domingos is an obituary writer with a famous father, a career he hates, and tons of questions. How does a person become a successful writer? How does a man get out of his father's shadow? But those concerns will dwarf the surprise he'll find in the first issue - a twist both he and readers will never see coming, which will grow into a mystery about the meaning of life itself.\n\n\n\nSource: http://BrazilTorrents.com/torrents.php?id=403\n\nComic Book Cover Art: http://eel.com.br/share.php?id=0C73_4B96EED7\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e27435ff7fe66a37f12b7d8ac32d8c3368a055bc","amp;dn":"Daytripper+N%C3%82%C2%BA1+%282010%29+-+Fa%C3%8C%C2%81bio+Moon+%26+Gabriel+Ba%C3%8C%C2%81+-%5BBrazilTor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e27435ff7fe66a37f12b7d8ac32d8c3368a055bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,116,53,255,127,230,106,55,241,43,125,138,195,45,140,51,104,160,85,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
