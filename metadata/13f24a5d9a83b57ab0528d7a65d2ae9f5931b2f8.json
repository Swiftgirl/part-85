His talents, however, are peerless, and he will do whatever it takes to get the job done, regardless of the ruthlessness involved. Convinced by his lover that itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s time to go straight, Max agrees to one last heist, which, of course, does not go as planned. Set up and framed for a much bigger crime than the one he signed on for, Max finds himself in a high-security prison where he must prove his mettle among the inmates. He forms an unlikely friendship with Ice Cool (Anthony ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTreachÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Criss), and together they orchestrate a massive jailbreak, setting out to extract revenge from whoever set Max up. Much witty banter, explosions, and general mayhem follow, in an action film that delivers all the crucial elements.\n\nRatings: IMDB: 3.9/10.0 (1,838 votes) | RT: N/A\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0431114&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0431114&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/today_you_die&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/today_you_die&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGenre: Action | Crime\nDirected by: Don E.
