I have got this to work quite well on Dosbox 0.73 and have included some basic instructions on how I did it which can be found in readme files in each of the two folders.  Hope everyone has the same luck with this that I did, have fun.\n\nIMPORTANT TO ANYONE DOWNLOADING THIS.\n\nI forgot the pdf file with the codes for The Secret Missions 2 so here they are so that you can copy them to a notepad file or something.
