Their track &quot;King of Wishful Thinking&quot;          \n         off the soundtrack became a runaway hit, and is their        \n         highest charting single to date, perfectly capturing         \n         the spirit of when the 80s became the 90s. When that         \n         happened they were already several years into their          \n         career, and many of their singles had been hits back         \n         in their native UK. Their sound can best be described        \n         as the bastard love child of 80s Genesis and Huey Lewis      \n         and the News, and some of their tracks are simply            \n         incredibly catchy! After the band had been dormant           \n         for several years, and 21 years after the release of         \n         their debut album, they made a one night only                \n         performance in Manchester, playing that entire album,        \n         as well as new material, and a few covers. While they        \n         might not completely manage to recreate their original       \n         80s sound, they prove themselves to be a terrific live       \n         band, and Peter Cox shows he's still got a very powerful     \n         voice.                                                       \n                                                                      \n           We've also thrown in the extra from the DVD, featuring     \n         backstage interviews with the band, as well as fans.         \n                                                                      \n           If you're in a bad mood after watching this, there's       \n         something wrong with you!                                    \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                     Enjoy!                                           \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                    \n                     \n                 \n                          \n                                \n                                                \n                               WHO WE ARE                             \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n           Since 2003, FLAiR has been dedicated to preserving         \n         the neglected titles of an entertainment era long gone.      \n         A time of classic kids flicks, painstaking hand-drawn        \n         animation and countless cheesy low-budget horrors. A         \n         time when pop had a King, and rock had a Queen. A time       \n         when special FX wizards ruled, and CGI was just one of       \n         their many tools.                                            \n                                                                      \n           Driven by nostalgia and memories of better days, we        \n         seek to relive those times, and share those memories.        \n         While our belief is that the 80s represent the very          \n         pinnacle of pop culture, we will not limit ourselves         \n         to one decade, or any single genre. We will not ignore       \n         the movies considered insignificant or even embarrassing     \n         by the studios. We will not disregard a timepiece just       \n         because it is dated.                                         \n                                                                      \n           Whereas most groups rely solely on digital sources,        \n         there are still thousands of rare and out of print           \n         titles, many of which have no planned digital release.       \n         We've made it our mission to dig these out, clean them       \n         up using the best hardware and techniques available to       \n         us, and share them with the world. Be it VHS, Laserdisc      \n         or more exotic formats, we're here to bring you the best     \n         (and worst!) of decades past. So sit back and enjoy as       \n         we uncover and pay tribute to an age of cinema we will       \n         never get back.                                              \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                    \n                     \n                 \n                          \n                                \n                                                \n                                 THANKS                               \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n           To groups and sites that have supported us along the       \n         way.
