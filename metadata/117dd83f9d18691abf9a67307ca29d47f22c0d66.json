The album was released on May 25, 2004 through Roadrunner Records, and a special edition, containing a bonus disc, was released on April 12, 2005. It is the band's only album produced by Rick Rubin.\n\nFollowing the band's tour to promote its second album in 2002, speculation regarding the future began. Some band members had already been involved in side projects including Murderdolls, To My Surprise, and the reformation of Stone Sour. However, in 2003, Slipknot moved into The Mansion to work on the album. Initially, the band was unproductive; lead vocalist Corey Taylor was drinking heavily. Nevertheless, they wrote more than enough material for a new albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the band's first to incorporate more traditional, melodic song structures and acoustic guitars.\n\nThe album received generally positive reviews. Slipknot was praised by Allmusic for its &quot;dedication to making it a Slipknot album&quot;,[2] while Q added that the album was &quot;a triumph&quot;.[12] The album peaked within the top ten in album sales across eleven countries, and went Platinum in the United States. The band also received the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance for the single &quot;Before I Forget&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:117dd83f9d18691abf9a67307ca29d47f22c0d66","amp;dn":"Vol.+3+%28The+Subliminal+Verses%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"117dd83f9d18691abf9a67307ca29d47f22c0d66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,125,216,63,157,24,105,26,191,154,103,48,124,162,157,71,242,44,13,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
