Its pretty cool, so yeah download it and seed but i will seed this forever so no worries about it being dead or whatnot (unlike my other torrents that my brother deleted excuse the deadness of those).  I'm cool like that.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Baron Van Wolfe","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:274907ef54ffd980f4539bfc91546c82909239c2","amp;dn":"Mahmoud+Awad+Discography+%28Shiekh+to+the+Future+and+Too+Fast+for+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"274907ef54ffd980f4539bfc91546c82909239c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,73,7,239,84,255,217,128,244,83,155,252,145,84,108,130,144,146,57,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
