They examine available evidence as well as talking to experts and eyewitnesses to learn more about such topics as global warming, possible 9/11 cover-ups, secret government weapons and apocalyptic prophecies. &quot;This is my personal journey,&quot; Ventura says, &quot;to prove that there is more to these stories than you know about.&quot;\n\nEpisode 1: The Secrets of HAARP\n\nHAARP, or the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program, was developed by international oil companies as a high-powered way to communicate with submarines utilizing extremely low frequency (ELF) radio waves to penetrate the ocean. When the U.S. military realized its potency, it bought HAARP.\n\nNow, some experts say, it also has a more nefarious purpose: to penetrate human skulls and control the minds of its victims.\n\nHAARP is housed in a massive 35 acre, 180 tower complex in Gakona, AK. The antennas can shoot 3.6 million watts of powerful radio waves into the uppermost part of the Earth's atmosphere, heating it up and creating irregularities that cause the ionosphere to bounce the radio signals back to the ground. But many skeptical Alaskans believe that HAARP is actually a sophisticated weapons system that can destroy incoming missiles, manipulate the weather and even control human brains.\n\nVideo: DivX 6 720x480 29.97fps [Stream 00]\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 48000Hz stereo 128Kbps [Stream 01]\n\nSome of you wanted the divx version so here u go, my apologies for those of you who d/l the previous torrent I u/l with the sound problems there were no other versions at the time.
