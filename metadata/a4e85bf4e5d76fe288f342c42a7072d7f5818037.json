Cydonia is a special place of interest, with many things to study. Hoagland has extensive coverage on this place, and search for his lectures viaet al...\n\nAgain, Mike Singh is credited with a lot of these finds! Also Others such as the late Dr Tom Van Flandern, Andrew Basiago, David Flynn, Richard Hoagland, zorgon, and of course Alex Collier. Also the many ATS members who provide such brilliant examples, and discoveries on the mysterious red planet.\n\nYou can view the video I made at you tube username : trippy123\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4e85bf4e5d76fe288f342c42a7072d7f5818037","amp;dn":"NASA+Mars+Anomalies+2010+-+watchZEITGEISTnow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4e85bf4e5d76fe288f342c42a7072d7f5818037","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,232,91,244,229,215,111,226,136,243,66,196,42,112,114,215,245,129,128,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
