It really gets tough when you try to make these things perfect in a single take (still havent come close).  The vast choice of new house tracks available at the time also made it hard to narrow down my selections; its sometimes a bit overwhelming especially when you're trying to keep a particular flow or feel. \n\nI recently downloaded some old school Doctor Who episodes which always remind me of when I watched them with my Father as a kid.  He used to watch the show all the time and I'll never forget the opening theme music so I mixed together the opening track....an ode to Doctor Who.  The Dalek's used to scare the shit out of me as a kid (am I alone on this?).\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\nn.a.K.\n\n\nYou can download all of my house mixes on my website at musicthroughscience d0t com\n\n\n\nTrack Listing \n\n   1. n.a.K.
