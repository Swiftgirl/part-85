Still traumatized by her        \n    sister's death and struggling with crippling agoraphobia, Jenny tries    \n    to cope with the overwhelming city and figure out her new life. When     \n    Jenny's over-enthusiastic Resident Advisor organizes a Welcome Week      \n    scavenger hunt, Jenny is reluctantly persuaded to join the game. But     \n    as she and her new friends decipher the cryptic clues texted to their    \n    cell phones - clues that lead them through darker and increasingly       \n    remote parts of the city - it becomes terrifyingly clear how high the    \n    stakes have become.
