It was the first single by the band to go to number one on the Soul singles chart and the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. It held that position, on the Hot 100, for four weeks from February 15, 1969, until March 14, 1969, and is remembered as a popular song of the 1960s. Like nearly all of Sly &amp; the Family Stone's songs, Sly Stone was credited as the sole songwriter.\n\nThe song is one of Sly Stone's pleas for peace and equality between differing races and social groups, a major theme and focus for the band. The Family Stone featured Caucasians Greg Errico and Jerry Martini in its lineup, as well as females Rose Stone and Cynthia Robinson; making it the first major integrated band in rock history. Sly &amp; the Family Stone's message was about peace and equality through music, and this song reflects the same.\n\nUnlike the band's more typically funky and psychedelic records, &quot;Everyday People&quot; is a mid-tempo number with a more mainstream pop feel. Sly, singing the main verses for the song, explains that he is &quot;no better / and neither are you / we are the same / whatever we do.&quot;\n\nSly's sister Rose Stone sings bridging sections that mock the futility of people hating each other for being tall, short, fat, skinny, white, black, or anything else. The bridges of the song contain the line &quot;different strokes for different folks,&quot; which became a popular catchphrase in 1969.\n\nFor the chorus, all of the singing members of the band (Sly, Rosie, Larry Graham, and Sly's brother Freddie Stone) proclaim that &quot;I am everyday people,&quot; meaning that each of them (and each listener as well) should consider himself or herself as parts of one whole, not of smaller, specialized factions.\n\nBassist Larry Graham contends that the track featured the first instance of the &quot;slap bass&quot; technique, which would become a staple of funk and other genres. The technique involves striking a string with the thumb of the right hand (or left hand, for a left-handed player) so that the string collides with the frets, producing a metallic &quot;clunk&quot; at the beginning of the note. Later slap bass songs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ for example, Graham's performance on &quot;Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Again)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ expanded on the technique, incorporating a complementary &quot;pull&quot; or &quot;pop&quot; component.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63c9323525892661f3c171f3a32ec6eda1beb876","amp;dn":"Sly+And+The+Family+Sone+-+Everyday+People++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63c9323525892661f3c171f3a32ec6eda1beb876","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,201,50,53,37,137,38,97,243,193,113,243,163,46,198,237,161,190,184,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
