With several years of research and comprehensive information gathering, Jack has a serious understanding of how the Global Super Elite do their business, and delivers a daily analysis of world events with satire and a song.\n\nHe understands and decodes the doublespeak, and groupthink of the mainstream media, and outlines the agenda of those who would seek to kill off or enslave the planet. Jack discusses mind control, corporate corruption, the police state, globalism, the United Nations agenda (inalienable rights vs UN privileges), secret societies, government sponsored terrorism, and collectivism vs individual sovereignty.\n\nJack Blood is an activist, an investigative blogger, multimedia artist, and a thought criminal. Deadline Live is an Infusion of music, culture, news du jour, opinions, and reality.\n==============================\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://americanfreedomradio.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://americanfreedomradio.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://deadlinelive.info/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://deadlinelive.info/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20f74d8747ea21d63fe9a60bb52f61ade80f6bf1","amp;dn":"Deadline+Live+with+Jack+Blood+-+2010+Feb+01+MO+%5Bsebaygo1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20f74d8747ea21d63fe9a60bb52f61ade80f6bf1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,247,77,135,71,234,33,214,63,233,166,11,181,47,97,173,232,15,107,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
