Tiga \ndemonstrates his uniquely French-Canadian brand of crazy. Diplo and Robyn \ncollaborate and fuck shit up. Justice x2. And Phantogram, oh my god. CTC\nis kinda of all over the place this month... hopefully in a good way.\n\nThanks so much to everyone who submitted songs. Unfortunately, I didn't\nget to use many (I'm trying to stick to 25 tracks as a max from now on),\nbut I really do appreciate all of them. I'll be sending all of you a\npersonal email ASAP.\n\nSubmissions used this month: Caro Emerald, Robyn + Diplo, and Two Door\nCinema Club (a version of the track I had never heard before, with an\nextended intro).\n\nKnow of a song or artist that deserves to be in a future CTC Playlist?\nLet me know here: http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dGlzY1d0elJwNUg4UFpEcTg0cVBOZlE6MA\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\n\ncut the crap playlists: a fresh batch of genre- and border-crossing\ntracks every month. good music, for free, monthly. it doesn't have to be\nnew... it just has to be good!\n\nbuying music and attending concerts is worth your money -- please do it!\n\nfind out about new ctc playlists first at the ONLY official ctc website: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://mindset.tumblr.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://mindset.tumblr.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n******ARCHIVED CUT THE CRAP PLAYLISTS NOW AVAILABLE AS .ZIP FILES: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://mindset.tumblr.com/post/412105443&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://mindset.tumblr.com/post/412105443&lt;/a&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nTracklisting:\n`````````````\n\n* = NEW!
