The series explores how it is that the ocean holds the very key to all life within its silent and shadowy depths. In each breathtaking episode we bring to life a vast, interconnected ecosystem: from the diversity and significance of microscopic plankton, to the sleek power of the OceanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s top predators.\n\n[i]One Ocean[/i] joins expeditions of discovery that take us to tropical coasts, to the deep, churning sea, and to meet strange and mysterious marine life that most of us will never get to see. We reveal a secret world beneath the waterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s surface:  energized with purpose, order, and the drama of survival. Complex environments inhabited by an astounding array of life forms, alternately splendid and graceful, are revealed like never before. Disarming, bizarre and plainly profound ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ [i]One Ocean[/i] bears witness a world that is at once intricately beautiful and achingly vulnerable. \n\nSeries webpage:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://oneocean.cbc.ca&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://oneocean.cbc.ca&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[b]One Ocean, Episode 1: Birth of an Ocean[/b]\n\nWe live on a planet that is almost all ocean - a water planet that is unique among the cosmos.\n\n[IMG]http://i741.photobucket.com/albums/xx51/Temptation_016/The%20Nature%20of%20Things%20-%20One%20Ocean%20Part%201/snap-2.png[/IMG]\n\nThe ocean is what transformed the Earth into the livable, blue planet it is today. However, in the earthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s earliest history there was no ocean ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ it was a red-hot planet of molten magma flashing through space.\n\n[u]The Ocean, Oxygen and Life[/u]\n\nWhere did all this water come from and how has the ocean shaped this planet over the last 4 billion years? The first episode in the [i]One Ocean[/i] series, [i]The Birth of an Ocean[/i], reveals the transformative power of the ocean on this planet ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and how the ocean drives everything on the Earth - from our temperate climate, to the air we breath to the land we walk on. No living creature could be here today if this dramatic event had never taken place.\n\nThe ocean changed our atmosphere by slowly filling it with life-giving oxygen. Peter Ward, a paleontologist with the University of Washington, takes us to Shark Bay in Western Australia to discover stromatolites ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“  an incredible bacterial formation which helped fill the ocean and later the atmosphere with oxygen.\n\nOxygen would change everything by allowing multi-cellular life to evolve and then flourish in the watery depths. [i]The Birth of an Ocean[/i] explores how a deadly chain of events was put into motion that caused oxygen to all but disappear from the ocean and atmosphere, launching a mass greenhouse extinction. As it turns out, most of the mass extinctions that have occurred were not caused by a massive asteroid, but by a tiny bacterium!\n\n[u]The Beginning of Life on the Planet[/u]\n\nThe story of the ocean is the story of the beginning of life on the planet, mass extinctions and astonishing survival in one of the most beautiful and mysterious parts of the planet. One of the most astonishing stories of endurance is that of the nautulis - a 500 million year old living fossil - an incredible species that managed to survive all of the mass extinctions. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an incredible story of survival but what are the adaptations and selective advantages that have allowed the nautilus to survive for so very long?\n\n[IMG]http://i741.photobucket.com/albums/xx51/Temptation_016/The%20Nature%20of%20Things%20-%20One%20Ocean%20Part%201/snap-3.png[/IMG]\n\n[i]The Birth of an Ocean[/i] joins paleontologist Ted Daeschler as he reveals the secrets of the fossil Tiktaalik, the critical transitional species that first crawled out of the ocean and onto land. We see just how much of our own anatomy we share with this amazing creature.\n\nTed Daeschler ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re looking at Tiktaalik, we're looking at an animal that's really at the base of the branch of the tree of life that leads to all limbed animals, and we're a limbed animal.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nUltimately [i]The Birth of an Ocean[/i] reveals that the history of the ocean is our own historyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and that today we are just beginning to understand its complexity and the immense influence it has on the planet and our own survival.\n\nThe series [i]One Ocean[/i] is produced by CBCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the nature of things and Merit Motion Pictures, in association with National Geographic Channels International. The Birth of an Ocean is directed and written by Mike Downie and produced by Tina Verma.
