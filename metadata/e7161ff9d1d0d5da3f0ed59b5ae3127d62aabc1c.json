This period, from the invasion of the Huns in 375 to the conquest of Italy by the Lombards in 568, is one of the most fascinating, significant and complex epochs in history.\n\nChilderich, the Frankish king, died in 482 and was succeeded by his son Clovis. The Roman Empire was coming to an end, with King Constantine in Constantinople ruling what was now the East Roman empire. The Germanic tribes had grown stronger. Clovis's army was close to being annihilated in the Battle of Tolbiac between the Franks and the Alamanni in 492, when Clovis appealed to the Christian god and promised to be baptised a Christian if he won the battle. He won, and was baptised in Reims Cathedral in 496 with 3000 of his warriors. Clovis realised he needed to work together with the Gauls to create a lasting empire. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gruppe5film.de/g5/en/history/the_germanic_tribes.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gruppe5film.de/g5/en/history/the_germanic_tribes.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nPart 1: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5264586/The_Germanic_Tribes_-_Barbarians_Against_Romans_%28Eng_Subs%29\n\n(SORRY MISSED CAPTURING EPISODE 2.
