What Really Happened is proud to be one of the oldest political blogs on the net.\nRivero runs the WhatReallyHappened radio show on GCN six days a week, and makes good use of his sharp wit to help his blog visitors and radio listeners not only to read/hear the news but to understand what IS really happening. \n\n===============================================================\n-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afd14242a5805160b815d862018dac88702c3a94","amp;dn":"What+Really+Happened+-+Mar+05+FR+%5Bsebaygo1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afd14242a5805160b815d862018dac88702c3a94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,209,66,66,165,128,81,96,184,21,216,98,1,141,172,136,112,44,58,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
