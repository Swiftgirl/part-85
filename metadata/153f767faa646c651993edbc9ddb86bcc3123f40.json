The game is set in a number of World War II battle theaters, from Burma to Norway.\nThe game centers around realistic gameplay and immersive environments. Weapon and vehicle physics are detailed. For example, bullets can penetrate wooden doors and other objects.\n\n\n__________________________\n\n\nBefore starting the game, the screen resolution must be changed in the game to match your screen.\n\nTo do that, right click on the game icon and click on &quot;Show Package Content&quot;.\n\nLaunch &quot;ScreenOptions&quot;, select &quot;Fullscreen&quot; and choose your resolution.\nDONT choose widescreen resolutions, as the game doesn't support it. \nThis will make the game cherish.\n\nJust choose the 4:3 resolution closest to your resolution.\nExample. Are you running a screen resolution of 1920x1200, choose 1600x1200, in &quot;ScreenOptions&quot;.\n\nClose &quot;ScreenOptions&quot;, and navigate to &quot;Contents&quot;.\nOpen &quot;Info.plist&quot;, in Property List Editor (Xcode Dev. Tools), or in your favorite Text Editor.\n\nFind the Line: &quot;/Program Files/Illusion Softworks/HiddenDangerous 2/hd2.exe&quot;\nand change it to: &quot;/Program Files/Illusion Softworks/HiddenDangerous 2/setup.exe&quot;\n\nRun the game, and a configuration too will launch.\nChoose the same resolution here, as in ScreenOptions (Example. 1600x1200); and setup your graphics options.\n\nClick &quot;Save and Exit&quot;\n\nNow you need to change the &quot;info.plist&quot; back to how it was before.\nTo do that, right click on the game icon and click on &quot;Show Package Content&quot;.\nNavigate to &quot;Contents&quot;, and open info.plist, like above.\n\nChange the line: &quot;/Program Files/Illusion Softworks/HiddenDangerous 2/setup.exe&quot;\nback into: &quot;/Program Files/Illusion Softworks/HiddenDangerous 2/hd2.exe&quot;\n\nSave the file, and Launch the game.\nHopefully everything should work :)\n______________________\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:153f767faa646c651993edbc9ddb86bcc3123f40","amp;dn":"%5B++Hidden+%26+Dangerous+2++-++for+Mac++%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"153f767faa646c651993edbc9ddb86bcc3123f40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,63,118,127,170,100,108,101,25,147,237,188,157,219,134,188,195,18,63,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
