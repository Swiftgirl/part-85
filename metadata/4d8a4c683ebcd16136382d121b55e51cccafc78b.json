Whenever I write or perform a new song, in my head I hear pianos and drums\nand tubas and string sections and jug bands and children's choirs. I want you to\nhear those things too. Except we couldn't find a children's choir whose parents\nwould let them sing about drug mules and transsexual prostitutes. Maybe next\ntime.''\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.stephenlynch.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.stephenlynch.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d8a4c683ebcd16136382d121b55e51cccafc78b","amp;dn":"Stephen_Lynch-3_Balloons-%28Retail%29-2009-SSR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d8a4c683ebcd16136382d121b55e51cccafc78b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,138,76,104,62,188,209,97,54,56,45,18,27,85,229,28,204,175,199,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
