In the mountains surrounding Raccoon City lurks something so vile, so horrible, that it would revile the bravest of men. Sent in to investigate a series of awful murders, S.T.A.R.S Bravo Team gets into the middle of it all when their helicopter crashes into the mountains. Starring Rebecca Chambers, and a new character Billy Coen, Resident Evil Zero is a prequel to Resident Evil 1. Explore new areas of Raccoon City, and search to uncover the secrets of the T-Virus. Control both characters simultaneously, switching between back and forth and splitting up to solve new puzzles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9acf03c496a62219662c013a44d811af6f54eb4f","amp;dn":"Resident+Evil+Archives+Resident+Evil+Zero+%5BPAL%5D+%5BWiiTorrentZ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9acf03c496a62219662c013a44d811af6f54eb4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,207,3,196,150,166,34,25,102,44,1,58,68,216,17,175,111,84,235,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
