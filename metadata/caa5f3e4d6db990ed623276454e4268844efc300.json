By the time THE LONG RUN was released in early 1979, the laid-back West Coast rock scene that The Eagles ... Full Descriptionhad dominated throughout the decade had pretty much run its course. Many of the biggest rock groups of the era -- including The Eagles--were incorporating new influences into their music and toughening up their sound. \n\nWhile similar in feel to HOTEL CALIFORNIA, THE LONG RUN is a far more diverse album that features an immaculately crafted set of songs ranging from the soulful pop of the Don Henley-sung title track and &quot;I Can' t Tell You Why&quot; to tough, country-influenced rocker &quot;Heartache Tonight&quot; and the epic, dynamic &quot;In The City.&quot; Even though Don Henley, Glen Frey and Joe Walsh would all go on to lead successful solo careers in the ensuing years, they would rarely better the polished pop on THE LONG RUN. \n\nRecorded at Bayshore Recording Studio, Coconut Grove, Florida. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:caa5f3e4d6db990ed623276454e4268844efc300","amp;dn":"Eagles+-+The+Long+Run+%28EAC.FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"caa5f3e4d6db990ed623276454e4268844efc300","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,165,243,228,214,219,153,14,214,35,39,100,84,228,38,136,68,239,195,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
