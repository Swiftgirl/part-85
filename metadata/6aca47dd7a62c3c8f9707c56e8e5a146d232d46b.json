The band astonishes with its ability to move between hard, driving rock songs and melodic ballads, shifting from the cutting distortion of electric guitars to a refined acoustic sound. \nIn 2009 they recorded their first EP, thanks to which they found a place in the underground (alternative) scene in Milan, where 'Smoking Kills Records', an independent label, discovered them and decided on a collaboration with them.\nAt the moment the band is recording their first album, due out in April, 2010, and they are planning a summer tour.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6aca47dd7a62c3c8f9707c56e8e5a146d232d46b","amp;dn":"Plastic+Made+sofa+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6aca47dd7a62c3c8f9707c56e8e5a146d232d46b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,202,71,221,122,98,195,200,249,112,124,86,232,229,161,70,210,50,212,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
