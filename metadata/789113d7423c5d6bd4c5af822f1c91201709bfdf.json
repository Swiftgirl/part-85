They are currently signed to EMI Finland. The band's albums are now distributed worldwide. The End Records acts as the band's official North American distributor, as Nuclear Blast Records provides distribution in Mainland Europe, Ireland and the UK. Australia will be handled by AmpHead Music. All Asia and Latin America releases are handled by EMI affiliates.\nMusic style\nInitially, the 69 Eyes' music style was of glam metal and hard rock, influenced by acts such as MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e and Hanoi Rocks. However, they began to incorporate more influence from gothic rock bands such as The Mission and The Sisters of Mercy. Their sound was described as a mix of the gloominess of gothic rock with guitar-powered rock'n'roll. Their music continued to show influence from other rock artists such as The Doors, Elvis Presley, Hanoi Rocks, Billy Idol, and The Sisters of Mercy as well as vampire films and literature. The term &quot;goth 'n roll&quot; is used by fans to describe their style. In recent times with the release Back in Blood, the 69 Eyes have moved back to a more guitar based sound, although gothic imagery and lyrical themes remain forefront in their style.\nBand history\n\nStudio Albums\n1.\tBump 'n' Grind (1992)\n2.\tSavage Garden (1995)\n3.\tWrap Your Troubles in Dreams (1997)\n4.\tWasting the Dawn (1999)\n5.\tBlessed Be (2000)\n6.\tParis Kills (2002)\n7.\tDevils (2004)\n8.\tAngels (2007)\n9.\tBack in Blood (2009)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:789113d7423c5d6bd4c5af822f1c91201709bfdf","amp;dn":"The+69+Eyes+Music+Video+Collection+%28ISO%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"789113d7423c5d6bd4c5af822f1c91201709bfdf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,145,19,215,66,60,93,107,212,197,175,130,47,28,145,32,23,9,191,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
