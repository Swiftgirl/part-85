A first person shooter where you play as a bodyguard to various political bigwigs. Aside from keeping yourself alive, you also can't let your charge be killed. I believe it uses the Quake 2 engine, though it has been modified. You can shoot out lights and shoot through walls and doors. Also, the game uses rag-doll physics. When enemies are shot, they slump against walls, fall out of windows, etc. rather than following pre-scripted animation.\n\n\nExtract Archive With Winrar Or 7zip etc.........\n\nThen Mount Image Or Burn To CD\n\nInstall The Game And Play\n\n\nENJOY AND PLEASE SEED\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:781ed9e7bf97d3859edf206f0fb0b5c674ccc729","amp;dn":"Secret.Service.In.Harm%5C%27s.Way.PC.Game%28djDEVASTATE%C3%A2%E2%80%9E%C2%A2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"781ed9e7bf97d3859edf206f0fb0b5c674ccc729","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,30,217,231,191,151,211,133,158,223,32,111,15,176,181,198,116,204,199,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
