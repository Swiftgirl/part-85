This is what I use.\nVLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.\nOne can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.\nQuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.\nPS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.\nAnd please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).Many of movies I encode have embedded subtitles. So far, only VLC player is able to use them correctly.\n\n&quot;Home&quot; of my torrents (for Bookmark/Favorites in your browser) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSAMPLE is included. Download it first, then decide (as usual for R5, audio sounds little &quot;hollow&quot;).\n\n--------------------------------------\nREQUESTS ARE &quot;ON HOLD&quot; TILL FURTHER NOTICE.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a43bac8ed1da4fcd01ae1fac492ed8d65a843ca","amp;dn":"From.Paris.with.Love.2010.R5.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a43bac8ed1da4fcd01ae1fac492ed8d65a843ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,67,186,200,237,29,164,252,208,26,225,250,196,146,237,141,101,168,67,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
