Is it done by man as a joke? So why do people have extraordinary experiences then? Flying ball of lights were seen in and around crop circles. Or is it an alien intelligence which try to communicate with us? The geometry which can be found in crop circles, includes a lot of mathematics which can be also found in nature.\n\nOur new documentary ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNew swirled orderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ deals with these questions and present some very extraordinary Crop circle formations in 2008, like the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½-formation in Barbury Castle or the Crop Circle near Avebury Manor, which showed our solar system with the planetary constellation of December 21 of 2012.\n\nPhysical anomalies prove that crop circles are a real phenomenon, not man-made. But what are they? Expressions of a multidimensional intelligence on our three-dimensional plane, or even messages from outer space, preparing us for a world-changing event to occur in 2012?\n\nOur new documentary tries to answer this question, featuring some of the most recognized crop circle experts, including Michael Glickman, Andreas Muller, Bert Janssen and Jaime Maussan.\n\nThe New Swirled Order is also available on DVD (PAL) and contains more than 2 hours of extraordinary bonus material.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nuoviso.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=439:new-swirled-order&amp;catid=79:spirituality&amp;Itemid=92&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nuoviso.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=439:new-swirled-order&amp;catid=79:spirituality&amp;Itemid=92&lt;/a&gt;\n\n  ____                      _                      _   _       _\n / ___|___  _ __  ___ _ __ (_)_ __ __ _  ___ _   _| | | |_   _| |__\n| |   / _ \\| '_ \\/ __| '_ \\| | '__/ _` |/ __| | | | |_| | | | | '_ \\\n| |__| (_) | | | \\__ \\ |_) | | | | (_| | (__| |_| |  _  | |_| | |_) |\n \\____\\___/|_| |_|___/ .__/|_|_|  \\__,_|\\___|\\__, |_| |_|\\__,_|_.__/\n                     |_|                     |___/\n   ____\n  / ___|___  _ __ ___\n | |   / _ \\| '_ ` _ \\\n | |__| (_) | | | | | |\n(_)____\\___/|_| |_| |_|\n\n\nPLEASE KEEP SEEDED TO PASS ON MESSAGE.
