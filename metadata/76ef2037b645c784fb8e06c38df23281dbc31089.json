Eddie is a patrolman played by Richard Gere who only has 7 days left before he can pull the pin and retire. Eddie has seen it all, and he has become so disenchanted with life that he must find some reason each day not to blow his own brains out. Undercover cop Tango played by Don Cheadle has been on the streets too long, causing him to protect Caz (Wesley Snipes) the drug kingpin target he is out to catch. Sal (Ethan Hawke) is a narcotics cop who is under tremendous pressure to provide a healthy home for his pregnant wife and two children. This stress from home and the temptation of all that drug money at his job is causing him to jump back and forth from being a good cop to a bad cop. In the end, all three police officers will eventually come together.
