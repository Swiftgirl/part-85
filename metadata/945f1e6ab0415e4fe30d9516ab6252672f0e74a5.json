In case of a malware attack, a Windows crash, or a problem caused by human error, RestoreIT lets you roll back your system to a point where it was last working properly. Since it loads before Windows, RestoreIT will launch even when Windows does not boot and recover all files, system and personal. RestoreIT's proprietary technology makes data recovery quick, painless, and accurate. You can search or browse for file or folders to restore in a Windows-like interface. System recovery returns every file on your hard drive to a static backup point, while file-level recovery lets you restore a select personal file to an incremental backup point, leaving other files on your system untouched.\n\nThis is Fully Funcional Version.\nNo Key or Serial required.\n\nSuraj","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:945f1e6ab0415e4fe30d9516ab6252672f0e74a5","amp;dn":"RestoreIT+Version+6.0.0+Build+20041011+%5BSuraj%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"945f1e6ab0415e4fe30d9516ab6252672f0e74a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,95,30,106,176,65,94,79,227,13,149,22,171,98,82,103,47,14,116,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
