The record was originally sold at 99 pence (in fact, &quot;pay no more than 99p&quot; was printed on the original sleeve), which helped ensure that the album peaked and remained at number 1 on the UK Indie Chart for 19 weeks and sold over 120,000 copies. Of note are tracks by English post-punk groups Everything But The Girl, The Monochrome Set and Felt, as well as a spoken word piece by writer Quentin Crisp.\nIn 2007 the album was repackaged as a 3-CD plus DVD box set featuring complementary tracks from the same period. This revised edition won the 2008 MOJO Award for Catalogue Release of the Year, with three of the key artists, Martyn Bates (Eyeless In Gaza), Lawrence (Felt) and Bid (Monochrome Set) appearing on stage to collect the award, alongside Cherry Red founder Iain McNay.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cda362368cd4ccefdb882554f72f419b9950653","amp;dn":"Pillows+and+Prayers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cda362368cd4ccefdb882554f72f419b9950653","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,218,54,35,104,205,76,206,253,184,130,85,79,114,244,25,185,149,6,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
