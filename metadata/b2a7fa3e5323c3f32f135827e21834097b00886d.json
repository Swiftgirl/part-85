This is the sort of movie that becomes a prototype for a thousand lesser films (including De Bont's lousy sequel, Speed 2: Cruise Control), but Speed really is a one-of-a-kind experience almost anyone can enjoy.\n\nRuntime: CD1 58:51 CD2 57:06\nFramerate: 23.976fps\nResolution: 800x336\nVideo: XviD ~1306kbps\nAudio: AC3 CBR 384kbps\nGenre: Action","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2a7fa3e5323c3f32f135827e21834097b00886d","amp;dn":"Speed_%281994%29.DVDRip.XviD.AC3.WAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2a7fa3e5323c3f32f135827e21834097b00886d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,167,250,62,83,35,195,243,47,19,88,39,226,24,52,9,123,0,136,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
