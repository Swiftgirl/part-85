Horror-esque strings, layered with Drum &amp; Bass grunts and sampled atmospherics bring a fresh vibe to get heads rocking. MCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Dave and Jalporte take on the microphone, laying down a powerful vocal track to set the scene and paint a disturbing vision of urban sickness and decay.\n\n\n\nDrum &amp; Bass Remix\n\nStaying true to the original mix, Predator PreyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own Drum &amp; Bass re-lick utilises all the sounds in SlingshotÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sonic arsenal to create a twisted Neuro Funk vibe. Deep and deadly subs, filtered with textured synths, pulsing bass lines and cutting beats set the scene in this slice of full on dance floor chaos.\n\n\n\nBit Basic Dubstep Remix\n\nUp and coming U.K. Dubstep and Glitch producer Bit Basic flips the script to deliver an upbeat, off the wall re-work of the original mix.\n\nQuirky chimes and bells dance over futuristic Dubstep beats that gradually build to a crescendo of smashing cymbals and crashes creating an alternative and uplifting outlook to the track.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2de3cd20af98df0b90c9e380bc66d781957acc0d","amp;dn":"Predator+Prey+-+Slingshot+-+Urban+Sickness+Audio+%28USA0806%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2de3cd20af98df0b90c9e380bc66d781957acc0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,227,205,32,175,152,223,11,144,201,227,128,188,102,215,129,149,122,204,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
