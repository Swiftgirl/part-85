Iran is building power stations and creating medical isotopes, all within the procedures set out by the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty [the treaty Israel refuses to sign]; Iran has not invaded another country in 200 years -- can the US say that?\n\nIsrael may get impatient and attack Iran themselves, they're saying it could happen in weeks; but if they do start the war the US absolutely will be drawn into it\n\n\n\n...and much more.\n\n \n\nFamiliar themes: US government warmongering, deceit and theft; the steady path to an ever more oppressive police state; wars and threats of wars being used to placate Israel and distract US citizens from economic disaster and the ticking debt timebomb\n\n\n\nMike manages to present powerful, persuasive stuff without screaming and yelling.\nPlease give his show a listen.\n\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance. I try to share information\n that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.\n NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as\n information.

What Really Happened is proud to be one of the oldest political blogs on the net.\nRivero runs the WhatReallyHappened radio show on GCN six days a week, and makes good use of his sharp wit to help his blog visitors and radio listeners not only to read/hear the news but to understand what IS really happening. \n\n===============================================================\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f06c736185364e5deff9c61235876cb90429e2dc","amp;dn":"What+Really+Happened+-+2010+Feb+16+TU+%5Bsebaygo1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f06c736185364e5deff9c61235876cb90429e2dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,108,115,97,133,54,78,93,239,249,198,18,53,135,108,185,4,41,226,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
