One quote:\n\n&quot;I'm sure that sitting in the middle of the capital city that is built by our tax dollars, Barack Obama may feel that the economy is doing o.k. because, hey, all his friends are doing just fine... but Kansas City is looking at having to close and possibly sell HALF of its schools to deal with the financial shortfall from the loss in tax revenue.&quot;\nSome places in New England have REAL unemployment is 30 percent, worse than the worst of the Great Depression.  \nStudy after study after study have shown that the Stimulus did not create new jobs.  It moved a lot of jobs around and it pumped a whole lot of money into various cronies and pork barrels.\nThe latest poll shows that only 6 percent of the people believe that the Stimulus created jobs.\nA rising tide of suburban homelessness across the US.  Middle class families becoming homeless; we are seeing the end of private home ownership in America.\nBanks are able to make more money by forcing you into foreclosure than by working with you to keep you in your home.\nBanks getting back into derivatives and credit default swaps.  \nBanks are growing richer of the misery of the American people.  \nBanks are not there to help you, they are the tools of your enslavement and impoverishment, and it's happening right before your very eyes.\nSo Obama can get up and say things are going great, but they are not.  We are at the beginning of a war between Wall Street and Main Street, and right now Main Street is losing.\nFormer Treasury Sec. Paulson says if the wealth was not at the top there would be nothing to &quot;trickle down.&quot;\nDon't know about you, but I am tired of being trickled on by Wall Street!  They're trickling on us and calling it rain.\n\n\n\n...there's much more.\n\n \n\nFamiliar themes: US government warmongering, deceit and theft; the steady path to an ever more oppressive police state; wars and threats of wars being used to placate Israel and distract US citizens from economic disaster and the ticking debt timebomb\n\n\n\nMike manages to present powerful, persuasive stuff without screaming and yelling.\nPlease give his show a listen.\n\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance. I try to share information\n that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.\n NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as\n information.

What Really Happened is proud to be one of the oldest political blogs on the net.\nRivero runs the WhatReallyHappened radio show on GCN six days a week, and makes good use of his sharp wit to help his blog visitors and radio listeners not only to read/hear the news but to understand what IS really happening. \n\n===============================================================\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e416181c935b03c67e180d8323df4f091458964d","amp;dn":"What+Really+Happened+-+2010+Feb+17+WE+%5Bsebaygo1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e416181c935b03c67e180d8323df4f091458964d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,22,24,28,147,91,3,198,126,24,13,131,35,223,79,9,20,88,150,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
