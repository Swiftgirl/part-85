Read by John Slattery.\n\nDuma Key is the engaging, fascinating story of a man who discovers an incredible talent for painting after a freak accident in which he loses an arm.\n\nHe moves to a &quot;new life&quot; in Duma Key, off Florida's West Coast - a deserted strip, part beach, part weed-tangled reef, owned by a patroness of the arts whose twin sisters went missing in the 1920s. Duma Key is where out-of-season hurricanes tear lives apart and a powerful undertow lures lost and tormented souls.\n\nHere, Freemantle is inspired to paint the amazing sunsets. But soon the paintings become predictive, even dangerous. Freemantle knows the only way forward is to discover what happened to the twin sisters and uncover the secret of the strange old lady who holds the key.\n\nThe story is about friendship, about the bond between a father and his daughter, and about memory, truth and art. It is also is a metaphor for the life and inspiration of a writer, and an exploration of the nature, power, and influence of fiction.\n\nunabridged 21 hrs 04min.\n\nazoozz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5324bda88a840d2eb96c4e3c4245e4ed2b5766c0","amp;dn":"Duma+Key+by+Steven+King+%5Bazoozz%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5324bda88a840d2eb96c4e3c4245e4ed2b5766c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,36,189,168,138,132,13,46,185,108,78,60,66,69,228,237,43,87,102,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
