She worked \nher way up through local clubs and Nashville bands until getting her \nbig break: singing &quot;Walkin After Midnight&quot; for a national TV audience\non the popular TV program Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts in 1957. \n\nThe song went on to make both the country and pop charts, and Clines \ncareer took off. \nShe was the first female country star to cross over into pop, with \nhits including &quot;Crazy&quot; and &quot;I Fall To Pieces,&quot; and her friendly \n&quot;Howdy, folks!&quot; style endeared her to fans. \n\nAt the height of her fame she was killed in a small-plane crash in \nstormy weather near Camden, Tennessee, while returning from a concert\n n Kansas City. \n\nShe released three albums before her death: Patsy (1957), \nShowcase (1961) and Sentimentally Yours (1962). \n\nCline was elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1973.\n\nShe used the stage name Patsy Hensley before marrying Gerald Cline \nin 1953.
