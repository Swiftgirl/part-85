This is a great album i got from a Russian forum. I wanted to buy the vinyl from a few people who were selling it online, but its a bit pricey because its rare...but the person who mastered it off vinyl did a great job and i salute him. Ever since i saw a clip on the You Tube site with Yul Brynner singing the second track on this album...i knew i had to have it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f281e737d1734ed687b9f7ec89e4ccb03573c335","amp;dn":"Yul+Brynner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f281e737d1734ed687b9f7ec89e4ccb03573c335","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,129,231,55,209,115,78,214,135,185,247,236,137,228,204,176,53,115,195,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
