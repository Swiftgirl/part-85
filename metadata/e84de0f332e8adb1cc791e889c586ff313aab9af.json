Originally released as a double album on two vinyl LPs, Zen Arcade tells the story of a young boy who runs away from an unfulfilling home life, only to find the world outside is even worse. The album incorporates elements of jazz, psychedelia, acoustic folk, pop, and piano interludes, concepts previously unheard of in the world of hardcore punk.\n\nGenre:\tPunk\nLength:\t70:23\nLabel:\tSST\nFormat:\tFree Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nSource: CD\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThere is no delight in owning anything unshared.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Seneca, Roman philosopher","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e84de0f332e8adb1cc791e889c586ff313aab9af","amp;dn":"H%C3%83%C2%BCsker+D%C3%83%C2%BC+-+Zen+Arcade+-+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e84de0f332e8adb1cc791e889c586ff313aab9af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,77,224,243,50,232,173,177,204,121,30,136,156,88,111,243,19,170,185,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
