Zaman (Sami Kaftan), and his wife, Najma (Shatha Salim), have built their happy life together in their house of reeds and, though childless, adopted a boy, Yacine (Hussein Imad), orphaned by the 1991 Gulf War. They have lived a quiet, contented existence until Najma falls ill. The local doctor tells them she needs surgery or some special medicine he does not have. And so Zaman sets off in his small boat and journeys up the Tigris to Baghdad in search of the precious cure. Thus begins the journey of salvation and discovery for Zaman: The Man From The Reeds.\n\nVisually so stunning and emotionally so warm ....The story itself is basically simple and very sad ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the main character's wife is seriously ill and needs an expensive medicine which is very difficult to find in the distant town. He leaves the reeds of his homeland to search for the medicine experiencing both humiliation and people's kindness during the long lasting journey. The film is characterized by beautiful photography and silently expressed feelings.\n\nÃƒËœÃ‚Â§Ãƒâ„¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ãƒâ„¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ãƒâ„¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ÃƒËœÃ‚Â«Ãƒâ„¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ãƒâ„¢Ã‹â€ Ãƒâ„¢Ã¢â‚¬Â : ÃƒËœÃ‚Â³ÃƒËœÃ‚Â¹ÃƒËœÃ‚Â¯Ãƒâ„¢Ã…Â ÃƒËœÃ‚Â© ÃƒËœÃ‚Â§Ãƒâ„¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒËœÃ‚Â²Ãƒâ„¢Ã…Â ÃƒËœÃ‚Â¯Ãƒâ„¢Ã…Â  .
