I hope you all like it.\nAgain not much to say about this.\n\nRipped with EAC\nIncluded:\n\nFLAC - 15 tracks - WAV TO FLAC\nLOG\nCUE sheets.\n\nTo burn to CD, simply use CUE sheets.\n\nNote: Cue sheets refer to WAV files. To burn FLAC to CD, you need to edit the CUE sheet.\n\n         So extention .wav must changed to .flac \n\nThis is 100% real. Support the artists by making a contribution. \n\nPlease SEED. I have limited upload capability so I'll be pulling this off soon. Consider others you share with, so please don't hit and run. Atleast give it 100% if not more just like others do for you.\n\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f7c7f416ae9f6ee785128b79c4b9cb214339832","amp;dn":"Aerosmith+-+Big+Ones+-+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f7c7f416ae9f6ee785128b79c4b9cb214339832","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,124,127,65,106,233,246,238,120,81,40,183,156,75,156,178,20,51,152,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
