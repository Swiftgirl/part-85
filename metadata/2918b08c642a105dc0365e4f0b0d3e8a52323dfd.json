It also allows players to use \nRecruit-A-Friend and Heirlooms with the guides, as well as do other \nthings in the game that could make the player get ahead of the guides. \nSuch things like doing instances or pvp with friends  #  , or simply getting \nunlucky with drop rates and getting ahead of the guide.\n\nNonetheless, when we released this system, it was meant to be a \nrevolutionary leap for leveling guides, which would fix many major \nproblems players were encountering with leveling guides as a whole.\n\nUnfortunately, this new system did not come without snags. The major \nproblem with the system so far is that many quests in the game are \npart of &quot;hidden&quot; quest chains - meaning the quests may be unlocked by \ncompleting another quest or something, but there is no clear chain of \nquests, which you might see on wowhead.com, for example.\n\nObviously, this needs to be fixed in order for SIS to work  #   at its full \npotential. So, for the last week, our team has been focused on finding \nthese &quot;hidden&quot; quest chains and tying them all together in our guides, \nso that SIS will work much more smoothly for you.\n\nThat's what this email is all about. We are happy to announce that \nboth our Alliance and Horde leveling guides have had these &quot;hidden&quot; \nquest chains linked together for levels 1-60.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.zygorguides.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.zygorguides.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nVersion: 2.0.736\nLast Updated On:\nJanuary 5th, 2010\n\nAlliance Guides Change Log:\nLevel 68-70 Guide - Verified all quest chains were tied together correctly, even &quot;hidden&quot; chains.\nLevel 66-68 Guide - Verified all quest chains were tied together correctly, even &quot;hidden&quot; chains.\nLevel 64-66 Guide - Verified all quest chains were tied together correctly, even &quot;hidden&quot; chains.\nLevel 62-64 Guide - Verified all quest chains were tied together correctly, even &quot;hidden&quot; chains.\nLevel 60-62 Guide - Verified all quest chains were tied together correctly, even &quot;hidden&quot; chains.\nLevel 55-60 Guide - Made sure all quest chains were tied together correctly, even &quot;hidden&quot; chains.\nDeath Knight  #   55-60 Guide - Made sure all quest chains were tied together correctly, even &quot;hidden&quot; chains.\nLevel 50-55 Guide - Made sure all quest chains were tied together correctly, even &quot;hidden&quot; chains.\nLevel 45-50 Guide - Made sure all quest chains were tied together correctly, even &quot;hidden&quot; chains.\nLevel 40-45 Guide - Made sure all quest chains were tied together correctly, even &quot;hidden&quot; chains.\nLevel 35-40 Guide - Made sure all quest chains were tied together correctly, even &quot;hidden&quot; chains.\nLevel 30-35 Guide - Verified all quest chains were tied together correctly, even &quot;hidden&quot; chains.\nLevel 25-30 Guide - Verified all quest chains were tied together correctly, even &quot;hidden&quot; chains.\nLevel 20-25 Guide - Made sure all quest chains were tied together correctly, even &quot;hidden&quot; chains.\nLevel 13-20 Guide - Made sure all quest chains were tied together correctly, even &quot;hidden&quot; chains.\nAll 1-13 Starter  #   Guides - Made sure all quest chains were tied together correctly, even &quot;hidden&quot; chains.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2918b08c642a105dc0365e4f0b0d3e8a52323dfd","amp;dn":"Zygor+Leveling+Guide+Alliance+v2.0.736+%285jan2010%29+WoW+3.3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2918b08c642a105dc0365e4f0b0d3e8a52323dfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,24,176,140,100,42,16,93,192,54,94,79,11,13,62,138,82,50,61,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
