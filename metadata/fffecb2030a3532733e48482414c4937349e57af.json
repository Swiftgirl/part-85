This version didn't actually have a public view until the late 90s, when it was released on VHS as part of the short-lived &quot;Very Strange Video&quot; series.\n\nTHE BLOODY DEAD takes CREATURE and adds a few minutes of new footage (trying to match sets and events) shot a fully 20 years after the original film. There are new sequences with a nurse (played by Australian actress Denise Coward), make-up man Ed French, and a couple of overweight cannibal inmates. Also, the various glove murders are now beefed up to more modern tastes with some gory inserts. The opening sequence where Kinksi is sentenced in a courtroom now appears at a later period.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fffecb2030a3532733e48482414c4937349e57af","amp;dn":"Creature+with+the+Blue+Hand%281967%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fffecb2030a3532733e48482414c4937349e57af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,254,203,32,48,163,83,39,51,228,132,130,65,76,73,55,52,158,87,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
