This torrent contains The Matrix Reloaded in MP4 format, ripped for MOBILE DEVICES.\n\n2. THIS IS NOT A HQ FULLSCREEN VID FOR COMPUTERS!!!!!! It has been COMPRESSED for viewing on SMALL screens.\n\n3. I have only tested this rip on 2 mobile devices (both support MP4/aac), SAMSUNG &amp; iphone.\n\n4. As far as I can tell, it should also be compatable with most mobile devices like PSP, ipod, and most cells\nthat have MP4 capabilities.\n\n5. I AM NOT YOUR TECH. Learn your device capabilities before you DL.\n\n6. DO NOT ASK ME HOW TO's. The only advice I can offer, is the only way I've tried, which is:\n\n download file to computer\n\n open explorer\n\n plug in mobile device to computer\n drag and drop file from computer folder to device (SD or memory card may be required for file space 1-2 Gb recommended for\nmultiple files.) Each file can be between 140-250 megs depending on length, and resolution bitrate.\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE: if you are using this for PSP, GOOGLE how to install, (unless you already know installation), \nbecause I did see online there is a sepecific way to do it, but the file (MP4) is compatable.\n\nHere are the codecs...\n\nVideo codec: MP4v (H.264)\n\nVideo bitrate: 192 (high resolution)\n\nResolution: 320x240 &lt;--some phones support larger screen size, like iphone/ (will still work)\n\nframe rate: 20 fps\n\naudio codec: MP4a\n\nchannels: stereo\n\nsample rate 22050hz\n\naac ext.: SBR\n\nfile size: 161mb (compressed from 701mb)\n\n\n\nSCREENSHOTS are using VLC MEDIA PLAYER (REDUCED) to show the *ACTUAL APROXAMATE SIZE* of how it would look on a mobile device\nThe torrent name is listed to show it is the actual file, and not a fake.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i183.photobucket.com/albums/x225/jonnoel1/mat1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i183.photobucket.com/albums/x225/jonnoel1/mat1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i183.photobucket.com/albums/x225/jonnoel1/mat2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i183.photobucket.com/albums/x225/jonnoel1/mat2.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n(this shot is the actual file ...it is only to show the screen size on my phone. The vid shown is a little blurry,sorry, but the vid looks really good playing.\n\n*note The Samsung Eternity phone in the pic WILL NOT play vids fullscreen. The size shown is the default phone size. Some phones will resize to default.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i183.photobucket.com/albums/x225/jonnoel1/matrix2mobile.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i183.photobucket.com/albums/x225/jonnoel1/matrix2mobile.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust keep in mind, I did make this for mobile devices with a high bitrate for HQ viewing. HOWEVER I did also test\nanother file at a LOWER bitrate of 128, (which decreased the file size approx. 100 megs), and it is not as high\nquality, but saves space for more files if you're on-the-go.\n\n(Check my torrents for:  128 bitrate vids (about 160 megs or so) for mobiles, its the lo-res I tested for quality)\n\nI WANT INPUT from people who use these to see which types you prefer, the smaller-low res space savers, or the high-res bigger files. \n\nA 2Gb mini SD card can hold around 6-7 low res movies, or 3-4 High-res movies. I am just looking for input for future uploads, so all\nfeedback, and constructive criticism is welcome. Thanks for checking the movies out, and I hope they work out ok for you! \n\n\n\nIf you Download this torrent, feel free to comment and let me know if it works on your device, (TECH TIPS WELCOME)\nso others can DL it to use on theirs as well (or not...lol). and PLEASE DONT FORGET TO SEED THIS TORRENT! Its a small file\n so it shouldnt take long to seed it out so PLEASE give back to the community and SEED! Thanks, and of course, ENJOY!\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e45b72525907982fcb658aabf1b61a815c73cc8d","amp;dn":"Matrix+-Reloaded_MOBILE+DEVICES_psp.cell+phone.ipod.etc._jonnoel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e45b72525907982fcb658aabf1b61a815c73cc8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,91,114,82,89,7,152,47,203,101,138,171,241,182,26,129,92,115,204,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
