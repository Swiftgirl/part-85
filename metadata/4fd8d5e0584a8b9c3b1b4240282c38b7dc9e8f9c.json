ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no question, though, that life - ferocious, vibrant, chaotic life - seems to pulse through every drop of ink they lay down. \n\nOriginally from Paris but now based in Marseilles, Bolino and Sury run a silkscreening studio from which theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve produced, through painstaking handmade effort, a decadeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s worth of books, comics, monographs, print-medium objets dÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢art and their flagship magazine Hospital Brut. Oh, and some wild films, too, short barrages of mindbending ocular mayhem assembled by an entire gang of artists. Le Dernier Cri, after all, isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t just Bolino and Sury, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a spectrum of edgy talent from Europe, Japan, the States and right here. - some review\n\nVery twisted animation from France, doesn't matter if you don't speak the language, it's all surreal.\n\nProps to the original ripper/upper.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fd8d5e0584a8b9c3b1b4240282c38b7dc9e8f9c","amp;dn":"Le+Dernier+Cri+-+twisted+adult+animation+1997","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fd8d5e0584a8b9c3b1b4240282c38b7dc9e8f9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,216,213,224,88,74,139,156,59,27,66,64,40,44,56,183,220,158,143,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
