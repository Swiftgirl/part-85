Things improve when he meets Alex - an aspiring model headed for New York - and a fast-talking pal promises to set up the demo. Then new setbacks: Alex isn't faithful, mom rejects him, rifts surface with his friends, and he's mugged by rivals. Everything hinges on the next rap showdown at the club. Can B-Rabbit pull truth out of his cap?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a64b14e327ea02e35a1afad0efa1a0167b281b6a","amp;dn":"8+Mile+%282002%29+DVD-R+NTSC+WS+%5Bwulfy1978%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a64b14e327ea02e35a1afad0efa1a0167b281b6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,75,20,227,39,234,2,227,90,26,250,208,239,161,160,22,123,40,27,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
