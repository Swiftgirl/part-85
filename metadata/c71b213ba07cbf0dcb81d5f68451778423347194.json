The King James Authorised Version of the bible is\nnear complete. Shakespeare warns The King [James] that\ninclusion of the Dream of St John will lead to blood. \n\nThe King and Shakespeare travel to Oxford to discuss the\nmatter with the Authorised Version's editorial team.\n\nThe play has a secondary theme, the nascence of The Tempest,\nShakespeare's farewell to the stage, and his fears for what\nthe Puritans are about to do to the theatre.\n\nIt might sound dull, but this is an engrossing play, and\nworth listening to just for the depictions of Shakespseare\nand James, and of their relationship.\n\nAlso, considering subsequent events, I suppose it's worth\nsaying that it would have been far better to have left the\nApocalypse out alongside the rest of the apocrypha.\n\nCast\nHugh Ross - King James\nEdward Petherbridge - Shakespeare\nRobert Stephens - St John\nHugh Dickson \nGarard Green \nMichael Barnes \nJohn Church \nEric Allan \nJohn Webb \nMelanie Hudson \nSiriol Jenkins \nDavid Learner \nPeter Penry-Jones \nRobert Mcintosh \nGary King \n.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c71b213ba07cbf0dcb81d5f68451778423347194","amp;dn":"BBC+R3+-+David+Pownall%5C%27s+%5C%27Dreams+and+Censorship%5C%27+sp7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c71b213ba07cbf0dcb81d5f68451778423347194","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,27,33,59,160,124,191,13,203,129,213,246,132,81,119,132,35,52,113,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
