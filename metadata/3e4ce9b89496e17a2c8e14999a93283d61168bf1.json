One of the most immersive, detailed RPG's out there - second only to Nethack in my book.\n\nThe music is strangely evocative, strange and atmospheric. Especially so, since it was all made with simple synthesisers.\n\n[1:39] 01 - Cythera - Main Theme.mp3\n[3:39] 02 - Cythera - Land King Hall.mp3\n[2:18] 03 - Cythera - Cythera Overworld.mp3\n[1:16] 04 - Cythera - Odemia.mp3\n[1:53] 05 - Cythera - Catamarca.mp3\n[1:18] 06 - Cythera - Cademia.mp3\n[2:42] 07 - Cythera - Kosha.mp3\n[0:59] 08 - Cythera - Pnyx.mp3\n[2:06] 09 - Cythera - Underground.mp3\n[1:13] 10 - Cythera - Danger.mp3\n[1:39] 11 - Cythera - Seldane.mp3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e4ce9b89496e17a2c8e14999a93283d61168bf1","amp;dn":"Cythera+Original+Soundtrack+-+Rare","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e4ce9b89496e17a2c8e14999a93283d61168bf1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,76,233,184,148,150,225,122,44,142,20,153,154,147,40,61,97,22,139,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
