Some even have four\nUnfortunately, Windows often doesnt manage your multiple cores\nvery well, so youre not actually getting the full\nmulti-processor power you paid for\n\nAshampoo Core Tuner enables you to use the full power of all your\ncores. For instant results you just need to select Auto-Optimize\nto optimize all the programs you are running or Boost to give\nmore power to a single program\n\nYou can also fine-tune individual processes, display a live view\nof the current workloads of all your processor cores and enhance\nthe overall performance of your system with additional tools\n\nInstant one-click results\n\nYou dont have to have a computer science degree to get all the\nbenefits of Core Tuner. The program manages your processor cores\nfor you to make full use of their power\n\nOne-click Auto-Optimize intelligently assigns the load of all\nthe programs youre currently running to make best use of all\nyour processor cores\nOne-click Boost does the same for individual programs. Just\nselect the program from the list and click Boost to give it\nmore processor power\nLive View shows you how all your processor cores are working in\nreal time\n\nFine-tuning for users who want more\n\nIf you want to really max out your machines performance you can\nmanually fine-tune the core workload settings for every program\nyou use\n\nYou can set the priority in five levels to adjust the amount of\nprocessor power each program gets. You can also specify how many\nprocessor cores each program gets to use. This can deliver\nparticularly good results with modern graphics and video editing\nprograms and other applications that make full use of multiple\nprocessors\n\nEvery time you change a programs settings a profile containing\nyour changes is saved automatically and can be reused whenever\nyou want. You can quickly return to your original settings or\nreload the profile to activate the saved settings in a single\noperation\n\nYou can also kill (terminate) programs that are stuck and\nprocesses that you suspect of malicious behavior\n\nAdditional performance-enhancing tools\n\nAshampoo Core Tuner comes with two very useful additional tools\nthat further enhance the power of your computer\n\nServices Manager lists the background programs (services\nthat Windows starts automatically even though most users dont\nneed them. It explains what they are and enables you to turn\nthem off. In addition to making more processor power and memory\navailable this can also improve security, because some of these\nautomatic services are actually security and privacy hazards\nStartUp Manager lists all the programs and utilities that are\nstarted automatically every time you run Windows and lets you\ndisable them if you dont need them. Many applications\nautomatically install such auto-start programs without asking\nor telling you and they then just run in the background all the\ntime, wasting processor power and memory. This can also be used\nto identify malicious programs, which often also install\nthemselves to start automatically\n\nSystem requirements\n\nOperating System\nWindows XP and Windows Vista (32bit\n\nComputer\nAny computer that runs one of the above operating systems at a\nreasonable speed. The best results can be achieved by\nemployment of a multi-core or multiprocessor system. These\nprocessors are built into all new pc systems\n\nMain Memory (RAM\nThe size of the main storage is insignificant for the\nemployment of the program.
