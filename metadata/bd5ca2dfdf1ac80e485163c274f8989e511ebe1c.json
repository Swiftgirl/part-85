Born Hensman Anthony, the sobriquet Firingee was used colloquially in deference to his Portugese origins. Although not much is known of his early life, Anthony arrived in Bengal sometime in early 1800s and subsequently came to settle in Farashdanga, in the town of Chandernagore in Western Bengal. He married a Hindu window and was deeply influenced by Bengali culture and language, as well as the Hindu religion. Eventually, Anthony came to learn the language and composed a number of noted religious songs in devotion to the Goddesses Kali and Durga. He is noted for his Agamani Songs, celebrating the return of Goddess Durga to her parents home that marks the Bengali Autumn festival of Durga Puja. Anthony is also noted for his literary face-offs in Kavigans, or Bard's duels, with a number of noted Bengali composers including Bhola Moira, Ram Basu and Thakur Singh. Anthony also helped construct a temple to Goddess Kali in the Bowbazar locality of North Calcutta that today is famous as The Firingee Kalibari . A 1967 Bengali film by Director Sunil Bannerjee celebrated the life and works of Anthony, and had noted Bengali actor Uttam Kumar in the title role. The film was noted for its music, composed by another noted famous Bengali Musician Manna Dey, and earned Uttam Kumar an Indian National Film Award for Best Actor in 1968\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd5ca2dfdf1ac80e485163c274f8989e511ebe1c","amp;dn":"Antony+Firingee+-+1967","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd5ca2dfdf1ac80e485163c274f8989e511ebe1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,92,162,223,223,26,200,14,72,81,99,194,116,248,152,158,81,30,190,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
