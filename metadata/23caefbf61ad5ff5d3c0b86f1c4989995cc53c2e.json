Administrator   \n         does not  need  physically visit workstations   to change   \n         security  settings  or   install  patches.  Best  Network   \n         Security  is   intended for  securing,   protecting,  and   \n         maintaining  PC workstations within a  corporate network.   \n         This  network-based  password-protected security software   \n         lets you  completely secure  PC   workstations over  your   \n         network  as  well as   maintain  them   by  uploading and   \n         installing  any executable patches remotely.  It supports   \n         tons  of  security  restrictions, options  and  tweaks to   \n         control  access to  every bit of  Windows.  You  can deny   \n         access  to each  individual component of  several Control   \n         Panel  applets,  including  Display, Network,  Passwords,   \n         Printers, System and Internet  Options; disable the  boot   \n         keys, context  menus,   DOS  windows,   Registry editing,   \n         Internet  and   Network   access;   hide  desktop  icons,   \n         individual drives, Start  menu items, and  taskbar; apply   \n         password  protection  to  Windows and  restrict users  to   \n         running specific  applications  only,   Control  Internet   \n         Usage and  much  more. In  total,  Best  Network Security   \n         supports  over  600   different  security   restrictions,   \n         options and  tweaks that allow you to restrict  access to   \n         almost every corner  of  Windows. After you  install  the   \n         remote client  service application  on your workstations,   \n         the maintenance becomes  absolutely hassle-free. You just   \n         connect your administrator's computer to the net from any   \n         place  and remotely  change security settings, upload and   \n         execute patches as well as  schedule reboots,  shutdowns,   \n         and Windows Explorer  restarts just with  a  click of the   \n         mouse.                                                      \n                                                                     \n                                                                     \n                                                                     \n         Installation:                                               \n                                                                     \n         Install the server or client + GUI, copy the keymaker in    \n         the installed folder. Run the keymaker and patch the        \n         application. Click on generate button and copy the key it   \n         makes. Start the GUI application and register the           \n         application.
