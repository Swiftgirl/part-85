It has a rockier, new wave edge compared to his previous releases. The album peaked at number 59 on the Billboard Top Pop Albums chart and #31 in the UK in 1980. Donald Guarisco of Allmusic described Clues as &quot;one of Robert Palmer's strongest and most consistent albums,&quot; despite being somewhat short at 31 minutes.\n\nThe video to the first track on the album, &quot;Looking for Clues,&quot; aired on MTV's first day of broadcasting, Aug. 1, 1981. Universal Music Group, parent company of Island Records, has posted the video onwhile a shorter version appears on VH1 and VH1 Classic's Web sites. &quot;Johnny and Mary&quot; has also been officially placed on\n\nIn 1978, he released Double Fun, a collection of Caribbean-influenced rock, including a down-tempo and syncopated cover of &quot;You Really Got Me&quot;. The album reached the Top 50 on the US Billboard charts and scored a Top 20 single with the Andy Fraser-penned &quot;Every Kinda People&quot;. With its blend of Caribbean steel pan, violins and moving lyrics, &quot;Every Kinda People&quot; has become one of Palmer's best-loved songs, covered multiple times by other artists (including Chaka Demus and Pliers, Randy Crawford and Amy Grant) and cited by music fans and spiritual groups for its positive message. It reached #16 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nPalmer's next album was an artistic departure, concentrating on a rockier direction. 1979's Secrets produced his second Top 20 single with Moon Martin's &quot;Bad Case of Loving You (Doctor, Doctor)&quot;, which like &quot;Every Kinda People&quot; became one of his signature tunes. The #14 hit also gave Palmer his first Billboard Hot 100 year-end chart hit, just eking on at #99.\n\nThe 1980s saw 'Compass Point Star' Palmer find an increasing amount of commercial success. The album Clues, produced by Palmer and featuring Chris Frantz and Gary Numan, generated hits on both sides of the Atlantic, first with the radio-friendly single &quot;Johnny and Mary&quot; and then &quot;Looking for Clues&quot;. Catchy music videos matching the synth pop stylings of New Wave gave him much needed exposure to a younger audience. The success was repeated with the 1982 EP release of Some Guys Have All the Luck.\n\nRobert Allen Palmer (19 January 1949 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 26 September 2003), born in Batley, Yorkshire, was an English singer-songwriter. He was known for his soulful voice and the eclectic mix of musical styles on his albums, combining soul, jazz, rock, pop and blues.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11989b3df7d81c0b54019b1683b2804ad005b863","amp;dn":"Robert+Palmer+-+Looking+For+Clues+%28Live-Beat+Club%29+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11989b3df7d81c0b54019b1683b2804ad005b863","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,152,155,61,247,216,28,11,84,1,155,22,131,178,128,74,208,5,184,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
