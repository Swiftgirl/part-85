The band's sophomore effort, WINGS was the first time the five-piece band hooked up with eventual long-time producer Jack Douglas, and the result was an eight-song juggernaut of slashing guitars, pounding rhythms, and in-your-face attitude. The band's trademark dual-guitar raunch and vocalist Steven Tyler's vowel-chewing yelp can be heard loud and clear on slinky rockers like &quot;Same Old Song and Dance&quot; and &quot;Pandora's Box.&quot;\n\nThe band turns in a scathing cover of Tiny Bradshaw's &quot;Train Kept a Rollin'&quot; (originally done by Aerosmith's heroes, the Yardbirds), a track that became a fixture in the band's live set. There are also songs about the prostitutes strolling outside the band's New York City recording studio (&quot;Lord of the Thighs&quot;) and the edgy inevitabilities of living on the wrong side of the tracks (&quot;S.O.S. [Too Bad]&quot;). A too-often overlooked song on this record is &quot;Seasons of Wither,&quot; a melancholy epic penned by Steven Tyler during a windy winter day in New Hampshire. GET YOUR WINGS defined the muscular, sexy sound that would make Aerosmith one of the best rock acts of the '70s, and is the band's first bona fide classic.\n\n1. Same Old Song and Dance  \n 2.
