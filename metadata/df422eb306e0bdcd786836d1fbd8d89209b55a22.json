Tommorrow Never Knows \n\nThe risk that Phil Collins took in displaying painful lyrics at an obviously harrowing time could have been taken as self-indulgence, but 18 years on this album is still seen as his best and most assured. The Genesis drummer displayed dynamic arrangements ('In The Air Tonight'), melancholy piano ('You Know What I Mean') and Philadelphia soul ('I Missed Again'), and wrapped up with a cover of 'Tomorrow Never Knows' at which even John Lennon would have tipped his hat. After this album Collins embarked on an extraordinarily busy career that included a rejuvenated Genesis, film roles and huge solo success. This will always be the album closest to his heart, with the paint pot on the piano. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df422eb306e0bdcd786836d1fbd8d89209b55a22","amp;dn":"Phil+Collins+-+Face+Value+%28EAC.FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df422eb306e0bdcd786836d1fbd8d89209b55a22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,66,46,179,6,224,189,205,120,104,54,209,251,216,216,146,9,181,90,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
