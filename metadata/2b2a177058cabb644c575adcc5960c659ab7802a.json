Even the greatest heroes of the land have buckled beneath the overwhelming will of the amoral elite. When a series of grisly crimes pushes an unlikely champion to seek the truth, a mystery unfolds that could completely destroy everything he holds dear.\n\nThere Will be Brawl, the internet sensation, is a darkly humorous mini-series satirizing the classic game heroes you thought you knew and loved.\n\nCreated by Matthew Mercer and Zach Grafton. Catch new episodes the second Friday of every month.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is by far one of the best independent series I have ever seen, and I have seen many.\n\nAll the episodes are in .mp4 format.\n\nThey were downloaded so I could have them on my Nintendo DS :-D\n\nThis series deserve alot of respect. And I hope that if this series gets released to DVD, that those of you who like/love the series, buy it. I most certainly will :-D.\n\nThe series can also be found on http://www.escapistmagazine.com.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b2a177058cabb644c575adcc5960c659ab7802a","amp;dn":"There+Will+Be+Brawl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b2a177058cabb644c575adcc5960c659ab7802a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,42,23,112,88,202,187,100,76,87,90,220,197,150,12,101,154,183,128,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
