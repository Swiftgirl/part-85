It was the last of three Flash Gordon serials made from 1936 to 1940. The serial was produced and copyrighted by Universal Pictures.\n\nDuring the 1950s, the three serials were shown on television. To avoid confusion with a made-for-TV Flash Gordon series airing around the same time, they were retitled, becoming respectively Space Soldiers, Space Soldiers' Trip to Mars, and Space Soldiers Conquer the Universe. King Features Syndicate had acquired the rights for showing and eliminated the original Universal Pictures titles. In the mid-1970s, all three serials were shown by PBS stations across the US, bringing Flash Gordon to a new generation, a full two years before Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind re-ignited interest in the science fiction genre. The re-edited television version, with the title card reading Flash Gordon - Space Soldiers Conquer the Universe, was used for some video and DVD releases of the serial.\nTo be notified of more movies like this, please bookmark and subscribe to... &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.themeekgeeksclassicweirdmoviesblog.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.themeekgeeksclassicweirdmoviesblog.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0123aae4cc1cbbd1cd38641a5b9c6e35bf26056b","amp;dn":"Flash+Gordon+Conquers+The+Universe.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0123aae4cc1cbbd1cd38641a5b9c6e35bf26056b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,35,170,228,204,28,187,209,205,56,100,26,91,156,110,53,191,38,5,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
