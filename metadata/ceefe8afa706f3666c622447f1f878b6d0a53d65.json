In 1990, the group won the Billboard Music Award for Hot 100 Single of the Year for Hold On, and in addition was nominated for four Grammy Awards and two American Music Awards.\n\nThe Wilson sisters and Phillips grew up together in Southern California in the 1970s and 1980s. The three shared a love of music and songwriting, and developed their own style of vocal harmonies. In 1989, the trio signed with SBK Records.\n\nThe group is also known for being the offspring of prominent musicians; the Wilsons are the daughters of Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys, while Phillips' parents are John Phillips and Michelle Phillips of The Mamas &amp; the Papas.\n\nIn 1993, Wendy and Carnie Wilson released the Christmas holiday themed album, Hey, Santa!, a collection of classic holiday themes with an original song (the title track). In 1995, Chynna Phillips released a solo album, Naked and Sacred. The same year, Carnie went on to host her own short-lived syndicated television talk show entitled, Carnie!. In 1997, Carnie and Wendy, along with their father, Brian Wilson released The Wilsons and the single, &quot;Monday Without You&quot;.\n\nA Greatest Hits album was released in 2000, although the group did not officially reunite for the release. On March 29, 2001, they reunited to perform the Beach Boys' song &quot;You're So Good to Me&quot; at a tribute show to Brian Wilson held at New York's Radio City Music Hall. Chynna Phillips dedicated the performance to her own father John Phillips who had died a few days earlier.\n\nWilson Phillips reunited in 2004 to release California, an album of cover songs. A single, &quot;Go Your Own Way,&quot; a song originally recorded by Fleetwood Mac, peaked at #13 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. The album debuted at #35 on the charts with 31,000 copies sold.\n\nIn New Zealand, the album was a surprise hit, reaching the top 100 and amassing gold sales after &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot; topped the country's adult contemporary radio chart for several weeks.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ceefe8afa706f3666c622447f1f878b6d0a53d65","amp;dn":"Wilson+Phillips+-+Dream+Is+Still+Alive++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ceefe8afa706f3666c622447f1f878b6d0a53d65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,239,232,175,167,6,243,102,108,98,36,71,241,248,120,182,208,165,61,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
