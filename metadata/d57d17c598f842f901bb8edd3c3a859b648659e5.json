It has become my technique, my passion.\n\nThe audio mixing style is MAXIMAL. That's many trax mixed many ways...\n\nThis piece tells many stories from my life. The movements will take you through different forms of electronic music: House, Techno, Trance, Progressive, Electro-House, and even an a cappella. Some of the tracks are layered on top of each other (mashup or mixing?), and others stand solo.\n\nWell I have used this video backdrop while I perform for over a year now. This mix is now formally retired, and I hope you enjoy it.- fr3qnast3\n\nThe original torrent is still circulating on Mininova and The Pirate bay. It has been over a year and it is still alive. Mininova counts over 12,000 downloads, and I wonder how many were completed on TPB? There were a few bugs in there I wanted to fix, so here we go...\n\nThe original version was created using DV for an (intermediate) editing codec. This resulted in color shifts, and a lot of jagged edges, especially with HOT colors. The resolution was 720x480i with a 29.97 frame rate. When I converted the video to pal, it was looking pretty bad.\n\nFor this remastered version, I used uncompressed 8bit video at 1280 x 720P, with 29.97 frames per second. Working in a larger intermediate format helps retain as much of the original format as possible, and allows for the creation of a higher quality master.\n\nMost footage was SD, some was HD, and a small fraction was web resolution. It's hard to find good HD footage....\n\nThis version of the audio mix was from a gig last year. Most of the trax were from .wav files, except for a few which were not released in wav format, as those were .m4a. The output was 24bit 96khz (I use 24/96 audio when I play out:), but the final output was compressed to 16bit ac3.\n\nThis is the *PAL* edition. I preserved the video at a high rate and compressed the sound so that this will look crisp on projectors. There are no menus besides the opening screen. I think VJ's will like this one better because the video is progressive, and there are no menus other than the opening.\n\nInstead of running a quick recode to PAL which involves lopping off frames, I chose a HI-Q render method that blends frames together. It took over 2 days on HI-Q render mode to get rid of the judder.\n\nFinale output for main movie:\n4.5mbps VBR (7.7 MAX)\n720x576 25 FPS Progressive Video\n126 BPM 448 kbps Dolby Digital Professional\nFrench, English, and Mandarin Subtitles are BURNED IN.\nAn additional subtitle track has been added to the top of the screen to note the chapter names.\n24 Chapters\n28 Songs\n\n\nThe chapters:\n\n1) With my friends\nChillen at WMC 2006+2008. Missed 07, is was a mess...\n\n2) The idiots have taken over Detroit\nI thought Cerberus capital management would fail, but for the wrong reasons. I was right in the end though.\n\n3) Till death do us part\nI thought it would last forever.\n\n4) Death\nI was wrong.\n\n5) Follow me\nDreaming is way more fun.\n\n6) I'll be there in your life\nOne's love for another, and ones love for freedom crammed in to two visual movements.\n\n7) Ballsweat\nI am better than you, and I will take your girl. Detroit is a reoccurring vehicle, old Detroit muscle vs. new.\n\n8) I trusted you\nClassic betrayal. This happens to me every few months or so.\n\n9) Ego trip\n15 min of fame, but a little shorter.\n\n10) Are you ready...\n...to be seduced?\n\n11) &quot;The internet is a series of tubes...&quot;\nThis chapter is dedicated to former senator Ted Stevens, the internets mastermind.\n\n12) State of affairs\nThe world in small movements.\n\n13) MTV is a no.\nWhere are the videos? I always liked Channel 13 &amp; PBS better anyway.\n\n14) London Calling\nMadonna left us for the UK:(\n\n15) MTV evil business\nTheir business model depends on &quot;reality tv&quot;. LOL go figure...\n\n16) Drugs changed everything\nI left the game when I was 18, and that saved my life.\n\n17) Get lifted\nYo Phil! This one is for you!\n\n18) Freedom at any cost\nWe take liberty for granted, and the real cost is war through proxy.\n\n19) Climaxtic\nThis is here because the hero always gets the girl, right?\n\n20) Rebuild\nReconciliation with old friends really helps.\n\n21) All I ever wanted\nNow I have all I could ever want.\n\n22) Revolution\nResistance is not futile.\n\n23) The Limelight\nBesides the drugs, dancing was an all night affair.\n\n24) A new life\nThe future is...\n\nThe songs:\n\nThe Difference Machine - Randall Jones - Original Mix\nSuper Skunk - Noir - Deadmau5 Remix\nIdiots - Vandal - Audiojack Remix\nLucky Heather - Fanciulli - Dubfire's Lucky 13 Remix\nHydrology - Glenn Morrison - Original Mix\nMoan - TrentemÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸ller - Radio Slave's a capella Breakdown\nHide &amp; Seek - Imogen Heap - Tiesto's In Search Of Sunrise Remix\nSweep - Blue Foundation - Jim Rivers Vox\nIn Love With You - Atrium - Mark Knight Tool Room Vox\nPut Your Hands Up for Detroit - Fedde Le Grande (Claude Von Stroke Remix)\nMouth to Mouth - Audion - Original Mix\nCarry Me Away feat Emma Hewitt Micky Slim - Chris Lake - Funkagenda Spankd Mix\nReady To Go - Tom Craft and Republica - Club Mix\nEverybody Freakin - Mync and Dirty South - Original Mix\nElementos Fugaces - Agniezka Javith 's @ In Progresso Mix\nRoadkill - Dubfire - Danyelino and Maurizio Remix\nMy MTV - Noir - D.
