You upload a piece, then you have to wait until the person you have uploaded it to has passed it on.&quot; \n\nPlease, seed when you are done.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:017ebf1f38d4cb1e3f40475158757f5378adc0e9","amp;dn":"Alvin+and+the+Chipmunks+-+The+Squeakquel+-+NTSC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"017ebf1f38d4cb1e3f40475158757f5378adc0e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,126,191,31,56,212,203,30,63,64,71,81,88,117,127,83,120,173,192,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
