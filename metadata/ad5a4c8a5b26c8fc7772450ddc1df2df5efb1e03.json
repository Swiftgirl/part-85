His theory, which blends science and Christianity, is that man is evolving mentally and socially toward a perfect spiritual state. The Roman Catholic Church declared that his views were unorthodox.\n\nThe term &quot;noogenesis&quot; was coined by the Christian mystic Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. It means the growth or development of consciousness - the coming into being of the &quot;noosphere&quot;. Noosphere is defined as the sphere or stage of evolutionary development characterized by the emergence or dominance of consciousness, the mind, and interpersonal relationships.\n\n\n\nArt Video 2\n\n\nWorlds (Eric Wenger).mp4\n\nArtMatic Voyager Animation and Music by Eric Wenger\nAlien ships by Yann Minh.\n\nThe clip explores 3 possible planets, the first male, the second female and the third hybrid. \n\n\n\ntags: noogenesis, Yann, Minh, future, cybersex, virtual reality, cyberspace, 3D, HD, enlightenment, noonaute, evolution, spiritual, jesuit, art, consciousness, mind, alien, cyborg, android, technology, humanity, Chardin, Teilhard, philosophy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad5a4c8a5b26c8fc7772450ddc1df2df5efb1e03","amp;dn":"Yann+Minh+-+NooGenesis+%5BMulti.Media.Pack.RYBA777%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad5a4c8a5b26c8fc7772450ddc1df2df5efb1e03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,90,76,138,91,38,200,252,119,114,69,13,220,29,242,223,94,251,30,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
