Known as hard rock, it was loud, tough, energetic and \n       sometimes dark in outlook. They didn't know it, but Deep Purple, \n       Uriah Heep and, most significantly, Black Sabbath were defining \n       what first became heavy rock and then eventually heavy metal.\n       \n       Inspired by blues rock, progressive rock, classical music and high \n       energy American rock, they synthesised the sound that would \n       inspire bands like Judas Priest to take metal even further during \n       the 70s.\n       \n       By the 80s its originators had fallen foul of punk rock, creative \n       stasis or drug and alcohol abuse. But a new wave of British heavy \n       metal was ready to take up the crusade. With the success of bands \n       like Iron Maiden, it went global.\n       \n       Contributors include Lemmy, Sabbath's Tony Iommi, Ian Gillan from \n       Deep Purple, Judas Priest singer Rob Halford, Bruce Dickinson from \n       Iron Maiden and Saxon's Biff Byford.\n\n\n                             Big up all scene massive!\n\n\n    \n                                       \n                GROUP  INFORMATION          \n         9 Years of the Force and still    \n                      going strong                  \n     \n\n           What we are looking for:\n\n           * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n           * Fios x264 rippers or cappers\n           * also we have a contest to annouce we are in need of a\n           * new nfo ascii artwork design email us with your designs\n           * winners artwork will be added as our new nfo\n           * dont forget to tag your work\n           * If you think you can help contact us on irc\n           * or email us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;5b1d3429383e1b332e2833753a32&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa04aee5e67d9b61539feda1605a24ce15c46fd5","amp;dn":"Heavy.Metal.Britannia.2010.DOCU.WS.PDTV.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa04aee5e67d9b61539feda1605a24ce15c46fd5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,4,174,229,230,125,155,97,83,159,237,161,96,90,36,206,21,196,111,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
