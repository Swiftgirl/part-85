It was the second and final single released from his 2005 CD, Tough All Over.\n\nThe music video for this song features Gary singing the song in a casino town. It was directed by Paul Boyd.\n\nThe song debuted at #58 on the Hot Country Songs chart dated January 21, 2006. It charted for 33 weeks on that chart, and reached a peak of #4 on the chart dated August 19, 2006. In addition, it peaked at #61 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nTough All Over is an album by American country music artist Gary Allan. It was released on October 11, 2005 on the MCA Nashville label, and has been certified gold by the RIAA. Recorded after his wife's suicide, the album is more somber than his previous works, with several songs termed &quot;excruciatingly sad.&quot;\n\nTwo songs from the album were released as singles: &quot;Best I Ever Had&quot;, a cover of the 2001 Vertical Horizon song, and &quot;Life Ain't Always Beautiful&quot; . Both placed on the Billboard Top Ten Hot Country Songs charts.\n\nRhapsody (online music service) ranked the album #7 on its &quot;CountryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Best Albums of the Decade&quot; list. &quot;Allan's sixth album was the first one released after his wife of three years committed suicide. This collection of haunting, heartbreaking songs chronicles his pain and, ultimately, his path back to living. Steeped in grief, Tough All Over is one of Allan's most consistent efforts to date, thanks in part to his gift of conveying emotions like regret, heartbreak and emptiness in a single, well-phrased line.\n\nGary Allan Herzberg (born December 5, 1967) is an American country music artist, known professionally as Gary Allan.\n\nSigned to Decca Records in 1996, Allan made his debut on the United States country music scene with the release of his single &quot;Her Man&quot;, the lead-off to his gold-certified debut album Used Heart for Sale, which was released in 1996 on Decca Records. A second album, It Would Be You, followed in 1998 on Decca. Allan's third album, Smoke Rings in the Dark, was his first album for MCA Nashville (to which he has been signed ever since) and the first platinum album of his career. Its successors, Alright Guy (2001) and See If I Care (2003), were all certified platinum as well, while 2005's Tough All Over and 2007's Greatest Hits were both certified gold. A seventh studio album, Living Hard, was released later in 2007.\n\nOverall, Allan's seven studio albums and Greatest Hits package have produced twenty-two singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, including three that reached Number One: &quot;Man to Man&quot; and &quot;Tough Little Boys&quot; in 2003, and &quot;Nothing On but the Radio&quot; in 2004. Seven more of his singles have reached the Top Ten on this chart as well: &quot;Her Man&quot;, &quot;It Would Be You&quot;, &quot;Right Where I Need to Be&quot;, &quot;The One&quot;, &quot;Best I Ever Had&quot; (a cover of a Vertical Horizon song), &quot;Life Ain't Always Beautiful&quot;, and &quot;Watching Airplanes&quot;. Allan's latest album, Get Off on the Pain, was released on March 9, 2010. \n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a53054957e9d5e9278aa8eeb854ad04070f7b6a","amp;dn":"Gary+Allan+-+Life+Ain%5C%27t+Always+Beautiful++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a53054957e9d5e9278aa8eeb854ad04070f7b6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,83,5,73,87,233,213,233,39,138,168,238,184,84,173,4,7,15,123,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
