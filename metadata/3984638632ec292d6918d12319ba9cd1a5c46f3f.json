Whatever you do with your issues, you can    \n     make the process of bug tracking much faster because most of your     \n     actions involve two simple controls:                                  \n     Search for issues by typing queries in the search box using query     \n     completion                                                            \n     Modify multiple issues at once using the Command window.              \n     YouTrack offers even more ways to minimize the time you spend on bug  \n     tracking:                                                             \n     Create new issues by simply pressing Alt+Ins from anywhere within     \n     YouTrack.                                                             \n     Use extensive keyboard support to create, edit, and navigate between  \n     issues  all major actions have easy-to-learn shortcuts. For example, \n     to close an issue, you type fixed, and press Ctrl+Enter.              \n     Assign tags to group issues the way you like, regardless of their     \n     attributes. For example, you can create a tag like fix it today and   \n     associate it with issues from different projects, subsystems, etc     \n                                                                           \n                                                                           \n   \n     Install Notes:                                                        \n                                                                           \n     Unpack the release and store the JAR file somewhere that you want it  \n     to live permenatly.                                                   \n     run the following command to start the server:                        \n     java -jar youtrack-1.0.2.jar                                          \n     When running the setup, you will have to enter in your license user   \n     and key... put in anything you want.\n                                                                           \n                                                            -- sHOCK 2009  \n \n \n         \n              \n         \n  \n  + Group News +\n                                                                          \n      - Just as far as ever from the end...                               \n                                                                          \n      - We fully support the right of consumers to make informed          \n        decisions when purchasing software, and the ability to make       \n        legitimate copies (fair use) of legally purchased products,       \n        regardless of restrictive copyright protection.
