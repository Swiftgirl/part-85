GjerstrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸m - vocals\n    * Charles Forbes - vocals\n    * Arne DahlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸ - vocals \n\nA studio group comprising two Norwegians and one Englishman. They were offered studio time in London by a budget record label, augmented by strings and several studio musicians (the presence of Junipher Greene members Bent ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¦serud, Freddy Dahl and Geir BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸hren is confirmed, but Helge GrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸slie was most probably also there). The material is rather variable, starting with the excellent &quot;Witchita Falls&quot; but this standard is not maintained throughout - indeed most of the remaining tracks sound more like late sixties pop. &quot;Neptune's Empire Parts 1 and 2&quot; consisted of music for strings only. A mediocre curiosity piece only of historical value.\n\n1\tNEPTUNE'S EMPIRE\t1971\n\nBitrate: 192kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d07554d5e2acaeb9e89f56914973771461ef57d","amp;dn":"Neptune%5C%27s+Empire+-+%281971%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d07554d5e2acaeb9e89f56914973771461ef57d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,7,85,77,94,42,202,235,158,137,245,105,20,151,55,113,70,30,245,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
