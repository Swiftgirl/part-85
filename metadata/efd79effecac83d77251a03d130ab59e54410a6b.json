This is what I use.\nVLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.\nOne can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.\nQuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.\nMany of movies I encode have embedded subtitles. So far, only VLC player is able to use them correctly.\n\n&quot;Home&quot; of my torrents (for Bookmark/Favorites in your browser) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efd79effecac83d77251a03d130ab59e54410a6b","amp;dn":"Aliens.In.The.Attic.2009.DVDrip.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efd79effecac83d77251a03d130ab59e54410a6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,215,158,255,236,172,131,215,114,81,160,61,19,10,181,158,84,65,10,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
