FRONTLINE producer Rachel Dretzin (&quot;Growing up Online&quot;) teams up with one of the leading thinkers of the digital age, Douglas Rushkoff (&quot;The Persuaders,&quot; &quot;Merchants of Cool&quot;), to continue to explore life on the virtual frontier. The film is the product of a unique collaboration with visitors to the Digital Nation Web site, who for the past year have been able to react to the work in progress and post their own stories online. Dretzin and her team report from the front lines of digital culture -- from love affairs blossoming in virtual worlds, to the thoroughly wired classrooms of the future, to military bases where the Air Force is fighting a new form of digital warfare. Along the way, they begin to map the critical ways that technology is transforming us, and what we may be learning about ourselves in the process.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 699 MiB for 1h 26mn 4s 536ms\n\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\nLanguage          : English US\nSubtitles         : None\nGenre             : Documentary\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 986 Kbps\nAspect            : 608 x 336 (1.810) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 135 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65c296f18baf1adeb2d43614462a4f40ae6d0b9b","amp;dn":"PBS+Frontline.Digital+Nation.20100202.WS.PDTV.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65c296f18baf1adeb2d43614462a4f40ae6d0b9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,194,150,241,139,175,26,222,178,212,54,20,70,42,79,64,174,109,11,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
