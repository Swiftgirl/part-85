After ascending the heights of conceptual progressive rock on the preceding ...    Full DescriptionTHE LAMB LIES DOWN ON BROADWAY, Genesis was left between a rock and a hard place, trying to define its identity anew. With the odds against them they put in a fine showing on TRICK OF THE TAIL. The general musical mode is similar to that of LAMB--longish songs with well developed structures and arrangements and a straighter rock feel than the band's early work.\n\nLyrically, the band didn't attempt to equal Gabriel's conceptual mastery, choosing instead to tackle discrete subjects on each song; &quot;Squonk&quot; is about a mythical beast, &quot;Entangled&quot; centers around an unpleasant hospital stay. Phil Collins, technically a better vocalist than Gabriel to begin with, steps up admirably as lead singer (he'd already sung lead on a couple of earlier Genesis tunes), but despite the popular myth he didn't take over the band. He receives co-writing credit for only two songs on TRICK OF THE TAIL, an album that's very much a group effort.\nRecorded at Trident Studios, London, England in October &amp; November 1975.\n\nGenesis: Phil Collins (vocals, drums, percussion); Steve Hackett (electric &amp; 12-string guitars); Tony Banks (12-string guitar, piano, keyboards); Mike Rutherford (12-string guitar, bass).\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:541e4603fdfce83c4eaaadb88e94433cddca0885","amp;dn":"Genesis+-+A+Trick+of+the+Tail+%28EAC.FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"541e4603fdfce83c4eaaadb88e94433cddca0885","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,30,70,3,253,252,232,60,78,170,173,184,142,148,67,60,221,202,8,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
