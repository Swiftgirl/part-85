Using incredibly powerful computer\nservers spread around the world, Google wants to become the primary\ndepository of all things digital about you - your e-mail messages,\nyour documents, your music, your movies, your television shows, your\nfavourite web sites, your financial transactions, perhaps in the future\neven your medical history will reside in Google's cloud. In return, you\nwill be able to access everything, everywhere and at any time.\n\nHow and why Google is approaching this daunting endeavour is the focus\nof the behind-the-scenes documentary. Filmed in Google offices in China,\nRussia and at the Googleplex, its Silicon Valley headquarters, the\ndocumentary reveals a corporate philosophy and attitude unique among\nmajor companies today. Beyond its &quot;Don't be evil&quot; motto, Google has set\nas its goal &quot;to organize all the world's information and make it universally\naccessible and useful&quot; and to do it in the next 300 years. As Google CEO,\nEric Schmidt says in the documentary, &quot;Successful companies start with\nvery audacious goals.&quot; If Google achieves its goals, it will not just be\nsuccessful; it may very well become the most powerful company in the world.\n\nGoogle World is produced by Ted Remerowski for Centillion Productions\nLtd. in association with CBC-TV.\n\nYours truly","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c26eaccca13e1703732d409b95ba0c383ff5d46e","amp;dn":"Doc.Zone-Google_World.2010.HDTV.XviD-YT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c26eaccca13e1703732d409b95ba0c383ff5d46e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,110,172,204,161,62,23,3,115,45,64,155,149,186,12,56,63,245,212,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
