Already a box-office smash in Korea, Thirst was honored with the Prix du Jury [Jury Prize] at the 2009 Cannes International Film Festival. Continuing his explorations of human existence in extreme circumstances, the director spins a tale that he conceived and then developed over several years with co-screenwriter Chung Seo-kyung, inspired by Ãƒâ€°mile Zola's Therese Raquin. Sang-hyun (played by top Korean star Song Kang-ho, of The Good The Bad The Weird, The Host and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance) is a priest who cherishes life; so much so, that he selflessly volunteers for a secret vaccine development project meant to eradicate a deadly virus. But the virus takes the priest, and a blood transfusion is urgently ordered up for him. The blood he receives is infected, so Sang-hyun lives but now exists as a vampire. Struggling with his newfound carnal desire for blood, Sang-hyun s faith is further strained when a childhood friend's wife, Tae-ju (Kim Ok-vin) comes to him asking for his help in escaping her life. Sang-hyun soon plunges into a world of sensual pleasures, finding himself on intimate terms with the Seven Deadly Sins.\n\n \n\nAudio :   Korean  - Dolby Digital 5.1 - 448 Kbps    \n\nSubs : English (hard subbed, appears above other subs), French, Spanish, Chinese x2, Arabic.\n\nWidescreen 2.35:1\n133 min\nNTSC\nCustom menu\n\nSource : R1DVD9 Rental, with custom added subs.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b950207dd7b6135f78c806d848aa2e457eb1de03","amp;dn":"Thirst+2009+DVDR-sailo1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b950207dd7b6135f78c806d848aa2e457eb1de03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,80,32,125,215,182,19,95,120,200,6,216,72,170,46,69,126,177,222,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
