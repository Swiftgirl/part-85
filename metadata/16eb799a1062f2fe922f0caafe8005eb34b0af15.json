Give and you'll be given.\n\nI am a sort of refugee from &quot;minimalistic-was-a-star&quot;. Many of my friends, my &quot;Regulars&quot; came on TPB following my torrents. It takes a long time not just to make people to &quot;recognize&quot; my small-sized stuff, but to adopt specific models of behaviour, when they interact, cooperate one with each other, exchange and, at the end, enjoy shows and movies. \n\nOne thing I have always repeated: Solidarity. We, people from &quot;Developed countries&quot; seem like have forgotten too easy what was only five-six years back when majority was on dial-up, wrestling with 2-4 kB/s. \n\nWe also forget how hard is to live far away from all cultural, sociological cushions our societies have provided for us, be surrounded with unbearable hardness of life, live surrounded by unimaginable poverty, diseases - and a feeling of total disconnection from the rest of the shiny world, where obviously, no one cares about anything else but themselves. We, who have more must share with the ones who have less&quot;. Must. Other &quot;types&quot; of behaviour are not welcomed - here. People who cannot share could go away, doors are open. Trespassers and punks will be escorted someplace else.\n\nWe are the rebels by nature, that's why we are here on place called &quot;Pirate bay&quot; ...not to eat each other's hearts out. We are here because world around is a dark place. People who come here are not the enemies, most of us struggle to survive, and taking just that and that much we need not to feel deprived by injustice. We are here to fight unrighteousness, but not amongst us. Never forget that.\n\n*********************************************************************************\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1220220&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1220220&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRelease Date: January 23, 2010\nGenre: Comedy\nIMDB Rating: 6.5/10 (183 votes)\nRT Critics: 3.9/10 (32 reviews)\nDirected By: Katherine Dieckmann\nStarring: Uma Thurman, Anthony Edwards, Minnie Driver, Samantha Bee\n\nIn Manhattan, a mother of two preparing for her daughterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sixth birthday party has no idea of the challenges sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s about to face in order to pull off the event.\n\n*** Small-sized 2-pass re-encode of xSCR for computers (PC, Mac), PS3 or Xbox, portable and mobile devices (Ipod, Itouch) . ***\n*** Video is 480x272 H264; audio is 44.1 kHz/stereo AAC LC and container is MP4. ***\n\nI can recommend CoreCodec for H264 (avc1, x264) video-playback, free DivX 7 for AAC sound-playback (and .mkv with AAC), Haali splitter (free, comes with CoreCodec) as the fastest and best combination for Windows Media Player. This is what I use.\nVLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.\nOne can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.\nQuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.\nMany of movies I encode have embedded subtitles. So far, only VLC player is able to use them correctly.\n\n&quot;Home&quot; of my torrents (for Bookmark/Favorites in your browser) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNOTE: xSCR = screener from &quot;unknown&quot; source (like DVDSCR, but little lower in quality).\n\nMany people - even if they think otherwise - cannot make a distinction between &quot;normal&quot; swarm and the swarm where initial-seedeing is performed. They say &quot;OK, 0/1 seeder&quot;; but infact, they do not recognize all implications of joining to initial-seeding swarm. To keep it short and simple, if anyone need/wants to save on traffic - for whatever reason - better is to stay away and wait till more than four stable seeders are present. Initial swarms are for the people who CAN put upload/download speed at 1:1 ratio - all other &quot;types of behaviour&quot; leads to semi-catastrophic consequences, not only to individual peer, but to ALL peers in specific swarm.\nWhy is that, I've explained nomerous times on name-not-to-be-spoken - and I might post this Q&amp;A part of the text here. Maybe.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTO ALL who cannot see all my torrents:\n\n&quot;....at 2010-01-22 19:03 CET:\ndude i can see only one torrent on ur homepage...\n\n&gt;twentyforty at 2010-01-22 19:34 CET:\n\nAbout page and one torrent...
