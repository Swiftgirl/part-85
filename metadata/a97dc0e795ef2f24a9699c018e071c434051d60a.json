This author of this plane is reported to have developed the Boeing 767 for both Overland and Level-D. I checked it out and the texture files, at least most of them, have the same names, albeit the Level-D version has a lot more files in each texture folder. Anyways, I did some experimenting and got the LVLD Aeromexico livery to work on this plane. I have included it in the torrent, just replace the original aircraft.cfg with the one in the texture.amx folder, then put that folder inside the SMS_767-300ER_W folder. Voila. The same technique should work with any of the Level-D 767-300 liveries.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a97dc0e795ef2f24a9699c018e071c434051d60a","amp;dn":"FSX+Overland+B767-300","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a97dc0e795ef2f24a9699c018e071c434051d60a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,125,192,231,149,239,47,36,169,105,156,1,142,7,28,67,64,81,214,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
