Time is       \n   your enemy and your car is your weapon as you race through the streets   \n   smashing everything on your way including fences, phone booths, street   \n   lamps and hordes of zombies. When the gruesomely mutated zombies         \n   become too much to handle, buy a new car or get more guns and upgrades   \n   installed. You can earn more money for finishing side quests, making     \n   kill combos and searching for hidden prizes. Game play is unrestricted   \n   and the player can freely roam through the dark streets, alleys and      \n   backyards searching for the best shortcuts or hidden power ups.          \n                                                                            \n   17 story missions with sub quests and bonus objectives                   \n                                                                            \n   Huge, free roaming city, infested by thousands of brain hungry zombies   \n   just waiting to be explored                                              \n                                                                            \n   6 different cars including an unlockable super car                       \n                                                                            \n   9 different upgrades for each car, which can transform even an           \n   innocent Taxi into a Chariot of Death                                    \n                                                                            \n   All cars can be mounted with miniguns, flamethrowers, rocket launchers   \n   or even dual railguns.                                                   \n                                                                            \n   All weapons have 3 upgrade levels which come with unique features.       \n                                                                            \n   Dynamic combo system with tricks and hordes of zombies to try it on.     \n                                                                            \n   Many vicious zombie types including even zombie dogs                     \n                                                                            \n   PhysX by NVIDIA                                                          \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n   RIPPED: DirectX and PhysX                                                \n                                                                            \n   PROPER reason:                                                           \n                                                                            \n   According to the S.R.R. then a proper is allowed, if it's minium 7       \n   disks smaller than the first RIP by OUTLAWS - ours is 8 disks smaller!   \n \u0004\u0004\n   Install Notes:\n         \n   1.
