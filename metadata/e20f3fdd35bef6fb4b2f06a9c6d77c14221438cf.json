Recording commenced in December 2008 at Brooklyn's Grand Street Recording with producer/engineer/bassist Ken Rich, as well as John Andrews and Matt Beck on guitars, Andrew Borger and Ethan Eubanks on drums, Andrew Sherman on organ, Jon Darling on harmony vocals, and Tracy Bonham on violin.\n\nABOUT THIS ARTIST:\nDaru Oda (born 1978 in New York, New York) is a singer/songwriter/multi-instrumentalist. She began playing the piano at age 6, flute at age 10 and most recently, the electric bass in 2004. In the summer of 1994, she attended MichiganÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Interlochen Arts Camp which motivated and encouraged her to continue on a path in music. She spent a year majoring in flute performance at DePaul University in Chicago, studying with Mary Hickey and Donna Milanovich as well as participating in workshops with Mary Stolper and Donald Peck.\n\nIn the summer of 1997, Daru left DePaul and moved to Lincoln, Nebraska to join the band Kid Quarkstar as their vocalist. The studio/touring experience with Kid Quarkstar inspired her to return to New York the following year to pursue jazz studies, performance and songwriting.\n\nIn New York, Daru began studying jazz piano with Sam Yahel but subsequently shifted gears into the singer/songwriter scene in the lower east side. It was there that she met and would eventually perform/record with a number of remarkable local musicians. (Richard Julian, Rachel Loshak, Teddy Goldstein, Adam Levy, The Brooklyn Boogaloo Blowout, El Madmo, et al.)\n\nFrom 2002 to 2007, Daru was a member of Norah JonesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s touring/recording band, The Handsome Band, as a harmony singer and multi-instrumentalist. During much of 2008 and 2009, she spent time performing in the States and Japan with Lisa Loeb (primarily as a duo or trio) in support of LoebÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s album, Camp Lisa.\nhttp://daruoda.bandcamp.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e20f3fdd35bef6fb4b2f06a9c6d77c14221438cf","amp;dn":"Daru+Oda+-+We+Could+Start+Raging+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e20f3fdd35bef6fb4b2f06a9c6d77c14221438cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,15,63,221,53,190,246,251,75,47,6,169,198,215,124,20,34,20,56,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
