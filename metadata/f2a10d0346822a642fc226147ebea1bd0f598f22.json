Feb. 2010: Final UK-NL offer to the government of Iceland, 19 Feb 2010\n\nConfidential offer from the UK, Dutch Icesave negotiation teams to their Icelandic counterparts. Iceland is to cover all monies associated with the UK/NL Icesave payouts, all currency and recovery risks, base interest as well as an effective 2.75% additional fee. The 2009-2010 period is excerpted from interest charges, which the offer values at 450M euro (how the figure is derived is not specified, but it equates to approx. 5.5% PA on 4 Bil EUR). The offer appears to be designed to be leaked, as it contains rhetoric about &quot;tax payers&quot; and similar irrelevancies. Indeed a sentence from the offer appears in a Reuters article filed at 18:04 UTC, February 19, six hours before the confidential offer was sent to the Icelandic government. In the Reuters' article, phrases are quoted from the offer by an anonymous source, clearly a sactioned British official, although this is not stated by Reuters. Similar &quot;sources&quot; selectively quoted the document to other media outlets including Channel 4 and the Guardian on Feburary 25, 2010.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2a10d0346822a642fc226147ebea1bd0f598f22","amp;dn":"Final+UK-NL+offer+to+govt+of+Iceland%2C+19%2F2%2F2010+%28Wikileaks%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2a10d0346822a642fc226147ebea1bd0f598f22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,161,13,3,70,130,42,100,47,194,38,20,126,190,161,189,15,89,143,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
