Friends tells the story of siblings Ross and Monica Geller, Chandler Bing, Phoebe Buffay, Joey Tribiani and Rachel Green.\n\nThe relationships are a little complex. Ready? Rachel and Monica were high school classmates, while Ross and Chandler have been friends since college. Joey and Phoebe seem to have met the gang a bit later on. At some point, Ross has loved Rachel, divorced three times and had a son with his first wife, who's a lesbian. Monica dated her dad's friend, the eye doctor, she had to wear fake boobs for a waitressing job and eventually married Chandler. Chandler's dad is a drag queen, played by Kathleen Turner, and his mom is Morgan Fairchild. He also had a nubbin. Joey's an actor whose greatest roles have been as a doctor with an evil twin on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; and Al Pacino's butt. Phoebe sings bad folk music, works as a masseuse and actually has an evil twin. Oh and she was a surrogate for her brother's triplets. Finally, Rachel took forever to get a real job, did not have an affair with Ralph Lauren, fell in and out of love with Ross, and then had his baby.\n\nEnjoyyy - Jz\n\n\nPS : One of my friend has repeatedly asked me to see this great show, if not for her I would not have watched this great show.
