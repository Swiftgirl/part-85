In this 1994 recording, the youthful Roberto Alagna as Romeo, and Leontina Vaduva as the unattainable Juliette, lead an excellent cast in a touching portrayal of this story of impossible love, based on the play by William Shakespeare.\n\nSung in French with English subtitles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0b9dda59c569cadac94125ebc686865bed2fcce","amp;dn":"Romeo+et+Juliette+-+The+Royal+Opera","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0b9dda59c569cadac94125ebc686865bed2fcce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,185,221,165,156,86,156,173,172,148,18,94,188,104,104,101,190,210,252,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
