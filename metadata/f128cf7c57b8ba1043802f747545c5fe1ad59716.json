As an Avatar, a human mind in an alien body, he finds himself torn between two worlds, in a desperate fight for his own survival and that of the indigenous people. \n\nGenre: Action | Adventure | Sci-Fi | Thriller\nIMDB Rating: 8.9/10   (44,515 votes)\nDirected by: James Cameron\nStarring: Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, Sigourney Weaver\n\nInput: Avatar.2009.HOMEMADE.READNFO.TS.XviD-D3M0NZ 1.38GB\nRuntime: 162mins\n\n*** Small-sized 2-pass re-encode for computers (PC, Mac), PS3 or Xbox, portable and mobile devices (Ipod, Itouch) . ***\n*** Video is 480x272 H264; audio is 44.1 kHz/stereo AAC LC and container is MP4. ***\n\n\nI can recommend CoreCodec for H264 (avc1, x264) video-playback, free DivX 7 for AAC sound-playback (and .mkv with AAC), Haali splitter (free, comes with CoreCodec) as the fastest and best combination for Windows Media Player. This is what I use.\nVLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.\nOne can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.\nQuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.\nMany of movies I encode have embedded subtitles. So far, only VLC player is able to use them correctly.\n\n&quot;Home&quot; of my torrents (for Bookmark/Favorites in your browser) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty&lt;/a&gt;\n\nInteresting &quot;Discussion&quot; to follow: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5191311/Cloudy.With.A.Chance.Of.Meatballs.PROPER.H264&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5191311/Cloudy.With.A.Chance.Of.Meatballs.PROPER.H264&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5190694/The.Bad.Lieutenant.Port.of.Call.New.Orleans.LIMITED.H264&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5190694/The.Bad.Lieutenant.Port.of.Call.New.Orleans.LIMITED.H264&lt;/a&gt;\nYour comments and opinions are welcomed, good and the bad ones.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f128cf7c57b8ba1043802f747545c5fe1ad59716","amp;dn":"Avatar.2009.HOMEMADE.TS.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f128cf7c57b8ba1043802f747545c5fe1ad59716","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,40,207,124,87,184,186,16,67,128,47,116,117,69,197,254,26,213,151,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
