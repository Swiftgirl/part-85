It all actually started in 1969 in Littleton, Colorado when  a 7 year old Kip Winger walked up to Peter Fletcher and said: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHey, you got big lips, you wanna fight?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Fletcher then stood up and towered over Winger at which point they started a band instead! They reconvened in the basement of the Wingers house where KipÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s older brother Nate was pounding on the drums. Blackwood Creek was born.\n\nThey went on to play every Jr. High and High school and eventually night clubs in their path, performing songs by their favorite bands like Grand Funk, Black Sabbath, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Led Zeppelin and their original songs which they were particularly passionate about, to the point of getting fired from jobs for not playing enough popular material.\n\nIn 1980 they went their separate ways. Nate and Fletcher went to Los Angeles,  Kip went to New York, where he landed a gig with Alice Cooper and then went on to form Winger. Nate recorded with many bands in L.A. including Ratt, Kix, Europe. Fletcher formed the Pigmy Love Circus, including drummer Danny Carey from Tool.\n\nBlackwood Creek reformed in 2007 to record 11 new songs. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s obvious that the chemistry is still rock solid. These 11 tracks embody 40 years of blood, sweat and tears of 3 musicians who started out together, went their separate ways and reform on common ground.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlackwood CreekÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ includes:\n\nOut In Outer Space; Nothing But The Sun; Your Revolution; Dead Stung; After Your Heart; Albatross; Jimmy And Georgia; Rack Of Greed; Love Inspector; Joy Ride; Wooden Shoe.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nThey deleted atso now it's here on Piratebay.org.
