And IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m really impressed\nabout their debut record! They are on the way to\nthe top! First big point is the vocals from EK\nEVIL, who has such power and melody in his voice\nand will give the band a bright audience! On the\nother side the band wrote big songs that are not\nweak, cheesy or something like that. The songs are\nhits! No filler on that record, which got a mighty\nproduction at the Panic Room in Sweden! The opener\nSWEET SISTER (which is an single output too!) is a\ngreat rocker! Highlight is YOU SHOOK ME, a track\nwho could be from an old Motley Crue record! Great\nmelodies, great power! After that 2 fast burner,\nCROSSES (KIXXX) is more a mid-tempo track and very\nclose to bands like Guns N Roses for example.\nEspecially the high screams from EK Evil kicks ass!\nSEXUAL SUICIDE is another highlight on that record!\nWhat a song! The following FALLIN` is a ballad with\na great guitar solo and the whole song reminds me\nagain on some G`n`R stuff. This track will crack\nthe radio stations in the states! Believe me! MISS\nCOCAINE shows more the heavy side of the band and\nwas led by an mighty kick ass riff and the unique\nvocals again! The fast ATTITUDE rocks before one\nweaker track follows. S.O.Y.L. is good, but canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t\nhold the high standard of that record. RIDE AWAY is\na burner with a forward punching drumming and SWEAT\nIT close that great record! If you like kick ass\nRock from Sweden or Sleaze Rock from the states ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“\nthis is your new masterpiece! The single features\nthe opener SWEET SISTER and the unreleased track\nFREAK CITY BLUES, a 2 minute Blues song with some\ninfluences from Mississippi. This song would fit on\nthe CD too!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33f9ce232ce4544348c8cba0ae208da4c609a517","amp;dn":"Hell+n+Diesel+-+Passion+For+Power+-2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33f9ce232ce4544348c8cba0ae208da4c609a517","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,249,206,35,44,228,84,67,72,200,203,160,174,32,141,164,198,9,165,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
