At the outbreak of World War II, the Slow But Deadly Dauntless was considered by many to be obsolete.\nThe Dauntless was the only US aircraft to participate in all five Naval engagements that were fought exclusively between aircraft carriers, and despite having been marked for retirement even before the war began, the Dauntless sunk more enemy shipping during 1942 than all other aircraft combined.\n\nProduct Description\nBuilt only for FSX SP1, SP2 and Acceleration (no planned version for FS9), the SBD Dauntless has a highly detailed virtual cockpit complete with 3d gauges and authentic textures, as well as switches to arm and drop the bomb.\n\nWith animations present and correct, including the crucial tail hook for those carrier landings. The authentic sound recordings also adds to the immersion as you open up the throttle and watch how the self shadowing, bump mapping and spectacular highlights bring any of the 6 carefully selected paint schemes to life.\n\nProduct Features\n\n    * Slow, powerful and delivers one hell of a punch.\n    * The famously rugged 1,000 horsepower Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1820.\n    * As with every VertigoStudios aircraft, it is gorgeously constructed, inside and out, down to the last rivet.\n    * Designed and built by the book.\n    * Custom cockpit systems and Tru3D gauges for the ultimate in realism taken far beyond what is available by default.\n    * Animated pilot, if your banking right your pilot will look to the right.\n    * Lights (built directly into the model) with under-wing landing light.\n    * Tru3D Instrumentation.\n    * Sound engineered from real SBD recordings.\n    * In cockpit pilot's map tray for handy in-flight navigation.\n    * Fuel delivery system simulated.\n    * All models include vstudios specialized materials.\n    * Pilot's notes pop-up 2D panel keeps important information easily available.\n    * Tru3D gauge lighting.\n    * Self shadowing VC and external model.\n    * High res textures throughout.\n    * Canopy open and close animations.\n    * Rear canopies open and close.\n    * Detailed PDF manual.\n    * 6 Aircraft paint-schemes.\n    * Engine start-up and shut down procedure.\n    * Ability to release the payload.\n    * Arrest hook for carrier landings.\n    * Approach light for carrier landings.\n    * Light bloom on glass and shiny materials.\n    * Full lighting management.\n    * Detailed pilot and rear gunner.\n    * Intermediate flight model for book flyers\n    * Easy flight model for fun flyers\n    * Custom made effects.\n    * Ability to look through the bomb scope for precision bombing.\n\n\nHave Fun!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da2b6b2f0bbbb332d536af1f50aadc6b0ed297f9","amp;dn":"FSX+Vertigo+Studios+SBD+Dauntless","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da2b6b2f0bbbb332d536af1f50aadc6b0ed297f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,43,107,47,11,187,179,50,213,54,175,31,80,170,220,107,14,210,151,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
