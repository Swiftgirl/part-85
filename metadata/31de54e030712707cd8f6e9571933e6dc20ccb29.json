This has been fixed\n    * Fixed issue that made the online check occur despite the user saying No\n    * Fixed it so that the nag screen doesn't show at the first try\n    * Fix in CueSheet handling to better deal with image files containing different block sizes per track\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31de54e030712707cd8f6e9571933e6dc20ccb29","amp;dn":"IsoBuster+Pro+2.7.0.0+Final+Multilanguage","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31de54e030712707cd8f6e9571933e6dc20ccb29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,222,84,224,48,113,39,7,205,143,110,149,113,147,62,109,194,12,203,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
