This area, talked about by Kenneth Grant and others, is the ground of existence, that which gives rise to everything else, but has largely been unmapped even though the area has been explored quite a bit. I try to impose some order on the chaos using experiences that I've had with the material. This is documented, along with several essays leading up to the map itself. \n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff48ed3c004f88c0a72e8ab16a42fae5c3fad3d3","amp;dn":"The+Ritual+of+the+AntiChrist+and+the+exploration+of+the+Night","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff48ed3c004f88c0a72e8ab16a42fae5c3fad3d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,72,237,60,0,79,136,192,167,46,138,177,106,66,250,229,195,250,211,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
