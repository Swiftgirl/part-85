He was raised in a favela in the city of Belford Roxo in the Baixada Fluminense region of Rio de Janeiro state. He is considered to be a renewer of Brazilian pop samba. Seu Jorge cites samba school, and American soul singer Stevie Wonder as major musical influences. He has released 4 solo albums and 3 DVDs, but much of his international recognition has come due to his acting in such movies as &quot;City of God&quot; (2002), &quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot; (2004), &quot;House of Sand&quot; (2005), &quot;Elipsis&quot; (2006), and &quot;The Escapist&quot; (2008).\n \nSeu Jorge on Wikipedia and IMDB: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seu_jorge&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seu_jorge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm1179580/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm1179580/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n=================================================================================\n\n&quot;Ana &amp; Jorge&quot; was recorded in 2005 during the &quot;Acoustic Tom&quot; project, a series of events promoted by the Tom Brasil show house (now known as HSBC Brasil).
