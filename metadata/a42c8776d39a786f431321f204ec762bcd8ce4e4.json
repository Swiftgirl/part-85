The program installs with nearly 200 movie entries,       \n        and with the ready-made professional templates (which            \n        determine the look and feel of your web site), you will          \n        have your web site up and running in no time.  With just         \n        the click of a button, hundreds (or even thousands) of web       \n        pages will be created for you (all that's left for you to        \n        do is upload them to your site).                                 \n                                                                         \n        Easily modify the HTML templates, change existing movie          \n        reviews, and add new reviews of your own.  The interface         \n        is so easy, that anyone with only basic computer skills          \n        can create a professional web site (yet the program offers       \n        HTML experts the ability to use their webmaster skills           \n        too).
