I am totally grateful for your services. I live in Ghana, West Africa, and so have very slow internet connection. It really makes a big difference in download time when the files are as compressed as yours. \nI was wondering if by any chance you were considering putting up the Academy Awards telecast tomorrow?? I would be even more grateful than I already am if you did!!\nKeep up the good work!! \n\n&gt;twentyforty at 2010-03-07 06:34 CET: \n\n@closetmaniac: Yes, because every year ceremony was released as 1.34 GB XviD (it automatically &quot;fits&quot; in by &quot;really big in size&quot;). Just be here around Monday noon. \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nNOTE: Main event hasn't been released yet by anyone. As soon as I get one, I would re-encode it and up the torrent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af642083512b6f457b7714f51e60c450a6713e84","amp;dn":"Oscars.Red.Carpet.2010.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af642083512b6f457b7714f51e60c450a6713e84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,100,32,131,81,43,111,69,123,119,20,245,30,96,196,80,166,113,62,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
