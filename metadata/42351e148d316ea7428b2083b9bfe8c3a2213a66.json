One day, an assassin named Helter Skelter appears before Travis and the two face off in a battle. Travis emerges victorious and finds himself in the presence of Silvia Christel, a mysterious French woman who claims to be an agent with the UAA. Silvia gives Travis official rank of 11 in the organization. Now, it's up to you to become #1. No More Heroes takes place in the city of Santa Destroy, and you are free to explore the town to your liking, taking on missions large and small to collect money and purchase new weapons as you work up towards the 10 main killing contracts. Gameplay is all about using your Beam Katana (via Wii remote) to defeat enemies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42351e148d316ea7428b2083b9bfe8c3a2213a66","amp;dn":"No+More+Heroes+%5BPAL%5D+%5BWiiTorrentZ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42351e148d316ea7428b2083b9bfe8c3a2213a66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,53,30,20,141,49,110,167,66,139,32,131,185,191,232,195,162,33,58,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
