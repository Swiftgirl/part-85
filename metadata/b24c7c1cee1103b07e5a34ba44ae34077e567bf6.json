Its mystery and magic can trigger something more, and something beyond, that can be transcendent. There is splendor in it.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\n(Lazaris)\n\nLazaris begins this eveningÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s exploration by pointing out why mattering matters: from feeding our soul to awakening our spirit to creating new ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œadult dreams,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ finding the mattering in our lives has immense value and power. Yet we resist. Beyond our resistance we can discover numerous avenues ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ avenues other than tragedy: exquisite moments and defining moments of love; engaging our minds \n(beyond our conscious brains); and seeking the light and beauty of our framework (memories, myths, dreams, and visions). We can stir the essence of mattering and capture that mattering in our lives: We can also consciously work with the fundamentals of mattering from humility to love and thinking/feeling; from possibility to courage and joy. Additionally, we can work with the seven notes and five tones of knowing. The evening concludes as Lazaris lays out a foundation of \ntechniques and then guides us in a meditation. That meditation, Finding the Mattering, is included. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://shop.lazaris.com/Finding_the_Mattering_in_Your__P590C60.cfm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://shop.lazaris.com/Finding_the_Mattering_in_Your__P590C60.cfm&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b24c7c1cee1103b07e5a34ba44ae34077e567bf6","amp;dn":"Lazaris+-+Finding+the+Mattering+in+your+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b24c7c1cee1103b07e5a34ba44ae34077e567bf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,76,124,28,238,17,3,176,126,90,52,186,68,174,52,7,126,86,123,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
