The song was written by Minogue, Henrik Korpi, Mathias Johansson and Karen Poole for Minogue's fourth album Neon Nights (2003). It is the album's opening track, and was released as its first single in November 2002. The single reached the top twenty in multiple countries, and topped the club charts in the United Kingdom, selling in excess of 60,000 copies. In February 2003, it was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association.\n\n&quot;Put the Needle on It&quot; received mixed reviews from music critics, and its musical style was compared to American pop singer Madonna.
