This entry in the racing series features 24 new reversible circuits, a load of fresh high-speed vehicles and some deadly new weaponry. There's also a new track feature called the Mag-Strip, which acts like a magnet and temporarily locks ships to the levels, enabling exciting things like loops and vertical drops. Newcomers to the WipEout franchise will likely revel over the introduction of a training mode, taking you through the basics. Most exciting of all is a new online multiplayer feature, where racers can battle each other at amazing speeds.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d6050d76c802c32c069a054eefb9daedaf70921","amp;dn":"Wipeout+Pulse+%5BPS2DVD%5D%5BPAL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d6050d76c802c32c069a054eefb9daedaf70921","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,96,80,215,108,128,44,50,192,105,160,84,238,251,157,174,218,247,9,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
