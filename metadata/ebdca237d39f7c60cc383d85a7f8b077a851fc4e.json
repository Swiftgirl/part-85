The set contains 21 CDs featuring every song that Sinatra authorized for release between 1953 and 1961, remastered in state-of-the-art 20-bit digital audio. Each CD contains an individual Sinatra Capitol LP (including singles compilations), but the bonus tracks from the American versions appear on a separate CD here as &quot;The Rare Sinatra&quot;.\n\nThe sound quality on this box is arguably superior to American remasters, also produced in 1998 for eight of Sinatra's key albums in the United States.\n\nMore info: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Capitol_Years_(1998_Frank_Sinatra_album)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Capitol_Years_(1998_Frank_Sinatra_album)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
