It didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t take long for the Teabaggers to overtake Arcadia University in Glenside, PA today as President Obama made a last-ditch effort to save his suffering patient, the health care reform bill as hecklers shouting something about abortion interrupted the speech, which is the first of several scheduled for this week.\n\nTime to call Glenn Beck and gas up those SUVÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s, Teabaggers!  Stop Obama in every city and maker sure NO American anywhere, ever has access to affordable health care.  Damn straight.\n\nAlso up for discussion is the deconstruction of Karl ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWho Me?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ RoveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s backpeddling book of lies and denials, which seems to have been written as a how-to guide for future defense attorneys who might have to defend one (or more) members of the Bush Crime Family at a future trial.  Go to www.karlrovebook.net and stop this maniac.\n\nAnd remember straight-as-an-arrow Californai state Senator Roy Ashburn? Guess heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s decided he is gay after all and dinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t just lose his glasses, but he still defends all his anti-gay legislation and statements anyway.  And you thought ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAlice in WonderlandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was the only big fantasy that was unveiled this weekend . . . .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90a356d17092b0c2e2b0fee5c19baeb07e6e4f90","amp;dn":"Mike+Malloy+Show+-+March+08+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90a356d17092b0c2e2b0fee5c19baeb07e6e4f90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,163,86,209,112,146,176,194,226,176,254,229,193,155,174,176,126,110,79,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
