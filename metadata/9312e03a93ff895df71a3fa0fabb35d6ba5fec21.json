 horrific accident, advertises for an amanuensis, an          \n             assistant to help him with his writing. He employs the       \n             amiable Jane Ryder to be his eyes as he revisits scenes      \n             from his past and works on what he intends to be his         \n             final opus. Jane appears to be ideal: attractive,            \n             intelligent, unruffled by her employer's abrupt              \n             eccentricities. But, gradually, we come aware that Jane      \n             has another agenda. Incrementally, Sir Paul's familiar       \n             surroundings are altered. Strange things happen around       \n             the house and he becomes increasingly dependent on his       \n             new assistant. Jane plays increasingly sadistic games        \n             until their relationship breaks down...                      \n                                                                          \n        Cast .......: Daryl Hannah as Jane Ryder                          \n                      Tom Conti as Sir Paul                               \n                      Miriam Margolyes as Mrs. Kilbride                   \n                      Simon MacCorkindale as Andrew Boles                 \n                      Elaine Paige as Canvasser                           \n                      Matt Kaufman as Interviewee #1                      \n                      William Ellis as Interviewee #2                     \n                      Craig Painting as Interviewee #3                    \n                      Brogan West as Interviewee #4                       \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                         \n                                                        \n                                                      \n                                                       \n                                          \n                  \n                        \n                           \n            \n                    \n                                               \n                                                          \n                                                             \n                                                             \n                                                                 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                               \n                                                  \n                          \n                              \n                             \n                  \n              \n                                             \n                                                    \n                                                         \n                                                 \n                                                                          \n                             RIPPER's NOTES                             \n                                                                      \n                                                                        \n                                                                        \n                                                                          \n                                                         \n                                                        \n                                                      \n                                                       \n                                          \n                  \n                        \n                           \n            \n                    \n                                               \n                                                          \n                                                             \n                                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                               \n                                                  \n                          \n                              \n                             \n                  \n              \n                                             \n                                                    \n                                                         \n                                                 \n                                                                          \n                                 WANTED                                 \n                                                                      \n                                                                        \n             We're currently looking for dedicated rippers.             \n              (.us, .de, .es, .fr, .it, .pl, .uk, .ru, ....)              \n                                                                          \n                               &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot;
