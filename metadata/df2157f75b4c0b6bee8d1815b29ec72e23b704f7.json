It was released on the PolyGram label. This album marked their status as a sort of political band with the song, &quot;Alien Nation&quot;; which was about the re-unification of Germany. This album had a contemporary touch to it, as the band were then going with the current trends, before later returning to their original style in Unbreakable in 2004.\n\nScorpions are a heavy metal/hard rock band from Hanover, Germany, probably best known for their 1980s rock anthem &quot;Rock You Like a Hurricane&quot; and their singles &quot;No One Like You&quot;, &quot;Send Me an Angel, &quot;Still Loving You&quot;, and &quot;Wind of Change&quot;. The band has sold over 75 million albums worldwide, and they were ranked #46 on VH1's Greatest Artists of Hard Rock program. &quot;Rock You Like a Hurricane&quot; is also #18 on VH1's list of the 100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs. After 45 years of performing, the band continues to tour and record music. On January 24, 2010, the band announced that they will be retiring after touring in support of their forthcoming album Sting in the Tail.\n\nIn 1993, Scorpions released Face the Heat. Bass was handled by Ralph Rieckermann. For the recording process, Scorpions brought in producer Bruce Fairbairn. The album's sound was more metal than melodic and divided the band's fan base somewhat. Many &quot;headbangers&quot; responded positively to the album while many longtime fans were put off. Neither the hard rock single &quot;Alien Nation&quot; nor the ballad &quot;Under The Same Sun&quot; came close to matching the success of &quot;Wind of Change&quot;. Face the Heat was a moderate success.\n\nRudolf Schenker, the band's rhythm guitarist launched the band in 1965. At first, the band had beat influences and Schenker himself did the vocals. Things began to come together in 1969 when Schenker's younger brother Michael and vocalist Klaus Meine joined the band. In 1972, the group recorded and released their debut album Lonesome Crow, with Lothar Heimberg on bass and Wolfgang Dziony on drums. During the Lonesome Crow tour, the Scorpions opened for upcoming British band UFO. Near the end of the tour, the members of UFO offered guitarist Michael Schenker the lead guitar job; an offer which he soon accepted. Uli Roth, a friend of the Schenker brothers, was then called in temporarily to finish off the tour.\n\nThe departure of Michael Schenker led to the breakup of the band. In 1973, Uli Roth, who had helped the Scorpions complete the Lonesome Crow tour, was offered the role as lead guitarist, but turned the band down, preferring instead to remain in the band Dawn Road. Schenker eventually decided that he wanted to work with Roth, but did not want to resurrect the last Scorpions lineup. He attended some of Dawn Road's rehearsals and ultimately decided to join the band, which consisted of Roth, Francis Buchholz (bass), Achim Kirschning (keyboards) and JÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼rgen Rosenthal (drums). Roth and Buchholz persuaded Rudolf Schenker to invite Klaus Meine to join, which he soon did. While there were more members of Dawn Road than Scorpions in the band, they decided to use the Scorpions name because it was well-known in the German hard rock scene and an album had been released under that name.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df2157f75b4c0b6bee8d1815b29ec72e23b704f7","amp;dn":"Scorpions+-+Alien+Nation+++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df2157f75b4c0b6bee8d1815b29ec72e23b704f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,33,87,247,91,76,11,107,238,141,24,21,178,158,199,46,35,183,4,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
