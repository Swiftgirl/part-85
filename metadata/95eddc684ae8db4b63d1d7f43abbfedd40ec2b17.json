This is 'In Nightmares', their debut album, which I'd say is a mix of Cobain-like vocals, avant-garde songwriting, and Hendrix-esque sonic experimentation, with the occasional awesome guitar solo.\nThese guys are a great local band, and by uploading this I hope get the word out about them.\n\nBest song: Pixilated.
