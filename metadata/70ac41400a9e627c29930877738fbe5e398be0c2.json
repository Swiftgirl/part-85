Her parents were into the occult and believed that Talias younger unborn sister Tayana was the key innocent sacrifice they needed to resurrect the Lucafix demon. Her mother could no longer have children on her own so a surrogate mother was used to bring Tayana into this world. Near birth they immediately started performing the sacrifice to assure a smooth transition of Lucafix from the underworld.
