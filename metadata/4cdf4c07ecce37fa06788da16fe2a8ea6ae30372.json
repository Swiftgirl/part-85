Six teams. \nThe jackpot? Two million dollars stuffed in a locker hundreds of miles away. \nThe odds of winning? One in six. \nThe rules? Well there's only one--get there first! \nWhat the racers don't know is that the tycoon and his rich buddies \nare betting on the outcome and are tracking every move the teams make.\nIt's only a matter of time before they figure out who really stands \nto win the most before switching course to look for a different kind of pay-off.\n\nPersonally I think this is &quot;a must see movie&quot;. It's hilarious! \nAlso I think there is a lot of great actors in this movie. \nRowan Atkinson make a great part as allways!\n\n\t\t\n\t\t:CAST:\nRowan Atkinson\t ...\tEnrico Pollini\n\nJohn Cleese\t ...\tDonald P.
