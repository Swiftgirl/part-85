These early films, which show the stirrings of the genius to come, remain the hidden treasures of a European cinema on the cusp of a golden age.\n\nTORMENT\nALF SJÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€œBERG, 1944 - 101 minutes\nIngmar BergmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first produced screenplay was for the great Swedish filmmaker Alf SjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶bergÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Torment, a dark coming-of-age drama about a boarding-school senior, Widgren, terrorized by his sadistic Latin teacher. When Widgren falls for a troubled local girl, Bertha, he finds himself caught up even further in a web of emotional mind games.\n\nCRISIS\nINGMAR BERGMAN, 1946 - 93 minutes\nIn Ingmar BergmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s feature directing debut, urban beauty-shop proprietress Miss Jenny arrives in an idyllic rural town one morning to whisk away her eighteen-year-old daughter, Nelly, whom she abandoned as a child, from the loving woman who has raised her. Once in Stockholm, Nelly receives a crash course in adult corruption and wrenching heartbreak.\n\nPORT OF CALL\nINGMAR BERGMAN, 1948 - 97 minutes\nIn Ingmar BergmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Port of Call, Berit, a suicidal young woman living in a working-class port town, unexpectedly falls for GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶sta, a sailor on leave. Haunted by a troubled past and held in a vice grip by her domineering mother, Berit begins to hope that her relationship with GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶sta might save her from self-destruction.\n\nTHIRST\nINGMAR BERGMAN, 1949 - 84 minutes\nA couple traveling across a war-ravaged Europe. A disintegrating marriage. A ballet dancerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s scarred past. Her friendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s psychological agony. Elliptically told in flashbacks and multiple narrative threads, Ingmar BergmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Thirst shows people enslaved to memory and united in isolation.\n\nTO JOY\nINGMAR BERGMAN, 1949 - 99 minutes\nAn orchestra violinistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dreams of becoming a celebrated soloist and fears of his own mediocrity get in the way of his marriage to the patient, caring Marta. Played out to the music of Beethoven, Ingmar BergmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s To Joy is a heartbreaking tale of one manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s inability to overcome the demons standing in the way of his happiness.\n\nMOVIES:\nDIRECTOR: Alf SjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶berg, Ingmar Bergman\nCOUNTRY: Sweden\nYEAR: 1944 / 1946 / 1948 / 1949\n\nDVDS:\nDVD RELEASE: March 27, 2007\nSTUDIO: Criterion\nCATALOG: ECL001\nSYSTEM: NTSC\nSCREEN: 1.33:1 OAR\nCOLOR: Black &amp; White\nAUDIO: Swedish Dolby Digital 1.0\nSUBTITLES: English \nRUNTIME (MOVIEs): 474 minutes\n\nEXTRACTION:\nENGINE: MacTheRipper 3.0 (R14m)\nDVD: 5 Full Dual-Layer DVDs\nFILE EXTENSION: .ISO (Image)\nDISC FILE SIZE: 6.19 GBs / 5.33 GBs / 5.73 GBs / 5.19 GBs / 6.09 GBs\nSCANS: Full Art Scan + Booklet\nART SCANS FORMAT: PNG (FROM 600DPI Original)\nBOOKLET FORMAT: PNG (FROM 600DPI Original)\nSCANS FILE SIZE: 177.7 MBs\nTOTAL FILE SIZE: 28.53 GBs\n*Sizes in decimal format\n\nABOUT THIS TORRENT:\n- Please enable DHT AND PEX\n- Download at will, but please be a good leech and help seed if you can!\n- Spread this torrent.\n\nAll my releases are scanned/ripped by myself.\nGET A LIFE COPYCAT-LAMERS!
