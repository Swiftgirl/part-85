You'll get the answer when you see how many times you know the answer in this game based on the hit show. Stretch your brain to cover 5,000 new questions in 28 categories, including Geography, Vocabulary, World History, Drama, Space Science, and more. Try and be a true whiz kid by reaching the Million Dollar Question without using your Peeks, Cheats, or Saves. You'll have to endure peer pressure from your classmates and the wisecracks of host Jeff Foxworthy. Play it like you see it on the show, with friends, or try new Three and Out and Schoolroom Showdown modes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1ec6847534f85e013b954f8664c740f32d57433","amp;dn":"%5BWii%5D+Are+you+Smarter+Than+A+5th+Grader+-+Game+Time+%28NTSC+Raw+Du","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1ec6847534f85e013b954f8664c740f32d57433","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,236,104,71,83,79,133,224,19,185,84,248,102,76,116,15,50,213,116,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
