Capturing the hilarity and awkwardness of adolescence perfectly, Bully: Scholarship Edition pulls the player into its cinematic and engrossing world set in the most vile and sadistic setting yet in a Rockstar videogame: the schoolyard. Laugh and cringe as you stand up to bullies, get picked on by teachers, play pranks on malicious kids, win or lose the girl, and ultimately learn to navigate the obstacles of the fictitious Bullworth Academy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4e67ff218fc0a07adfa88af42c15a29e2b588f6","amp;dn":"Bully+Scholarship+Edition+%5BPAL%5D+%5BWiiTorrentZ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4e67ff218fc0a07adfa88af42c15a29e2b588f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,230,127,242,24,252,10,7,173,250,136,175,66,193,90,41,226,181,136,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
