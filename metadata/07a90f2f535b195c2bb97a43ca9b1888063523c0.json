New at ripping to different file types but it looked pretty good to me.  I checked all the way through to make sure audio and video stayed in sync the whole time.  I always had a problem wth that in my earlier attempts.  If there is anyone who has a fool proof method they use themselves, please let me know in the comments.\n\nThanks and enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07a90f2f535b195c2bb97a43ca9b1888063523c0","amp;dn":"2009+G-Force","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07a90f2f535b195c2bb97a43ca9b1888063523c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,169,15,47,83,91,25,92,43,185,122,67,202,155,24,136,6,53,35,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
