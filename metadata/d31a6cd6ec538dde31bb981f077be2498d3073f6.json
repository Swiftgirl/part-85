Nearly all the best is here \nfrom Black Sabbath, Rainbow, Judas Priest and Deep Purple \nto Akice Cooper, Motorhead, van Halen and David Lee Roth \n(Oh yes, Diamond Dave as well). \n\nThis album is a must-have for any rockers record collection, \nand if you're new to the wide world of rock music; \nBuy this album and re-educate yourself.\n__________________\n\nCD - 1\n______\n\n1.
