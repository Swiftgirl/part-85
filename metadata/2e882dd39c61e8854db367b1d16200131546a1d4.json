Other 2nd hour topics include Ron Paul's &quot;Audit The Fed&quot; bill, socialized health care, bailouts and Tobin taxes.\n\n\nOther topics include the Obama gay lover/cocaine scandal and possible U.S. economic recovery solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
