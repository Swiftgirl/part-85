It hit radio stations on August 24, 2009.\n\nThe song debuted live on June 6, 2009 in Hartford, CT, days after the album's release.\n\nCustomers who purchased the iTunes Pass for the album received 2 bonus versions of &quot;You and Me&quot; on September 1, 2009, including an acoustic version of the song recorded in the studio and a live version recorded June 12, 2009 at Saratoga Performing Arts Center, Saratoga Springs, NY.\n\nDave Matthews Band appeared on Ellen on September 16, 2009 to play an outdoor concert on the Warner Brothers lot in Burbank, California. During the broadcast, the band debuted their newest single, &quot;You and Me&quot;.\n\nThis song was featured at the end of the season three finale of the SyFy series Eureka.\n\nThe music video for &quot;You and Me&quot; premiered on Yahoo!

Guitarist Tim Reynolds played on the album, marking his first recording with DMB since 1998ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Before These Crowded Streets. Rashawn Ross makes his first appearance on a DMB studio album since joining as a regular touring member in 2006 as well as Jeff Coffin, who has taken Moore's role since June 2008. The album was the first to be produced by Rob Cavallo, and first single on this album has been made available on their website.\n\nThe album is the second major release by Dave Matthews Band with a vinyl edition. Before These Crowded Streets is the only other album to have been released on that medium, albeit in a limited number.\n\nThe album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 424,000 copies in its first week of release. This marked the group's fifth consecutive studio album to open with a sales week of at least 400,000 copies.\n\nExactly six months after its release, Big Whiskey and the GrooGrux King was nominated for two Grammy Awards: Best Rock Album and Album of the Year.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dba4c9cd48bdb875b5234b0f3eefabc4b3ba7fb8","amp;dn":"Dave+Matthews+Band-You+%26+Me+%28Live+2010+Grammy+Awards%29+%28Xvid%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dba4c9cd48bdb875b5234b0f3eefabc4b3ba7fb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,164,201,205,72,189,184,117,181,35,75,15,62,239,171,196,179,186,127,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
