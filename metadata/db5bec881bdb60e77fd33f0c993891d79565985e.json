It will lose all of \nits colour and look like a piece of coal or, it will change from its present \ncolour, red, blue or green, into all the colours of the rainbow and the most \nfabulous patterns you have every seen. The scientific term for those that \nlose everything is 'isotropic' and the scientific that gave ALL the colours \nand wonderful patterns is 'anisotropic'.\n\nThere are 12 stones which will be used as the material for the New Jerusalem and \neveryone of them is anistropic. Now some of you ladies are going to be \ndisappointed here - diamonds are isotropic. \nDon't take them with you to glory - they have no colour, no brilliance. \nRubies - my wife will have to leave her ruby brooch behind because it has no colour \nin pure light. Garnets - no colour, but look at these...\t\t\n\nGreat Video Only 6minutes!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db5bec881bdb60e77fd33f0c993891d79565985e","amp;dn":"David+Pawson+-+Dark+Diamonds+2009.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db5bec881bdb60e77fd33f0c993891d79565985e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,91,236,136,27,219,96,231,127,211,63,12,153,56,145,215,149,101,152,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
