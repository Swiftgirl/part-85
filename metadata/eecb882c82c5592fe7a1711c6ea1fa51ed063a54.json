The only problem... he doesn't know he's the       \n           best. Ringo Duran, the son of Gracie Duran, a famous           \n           Argentinian kick boxer, works two jobs to make ends meet.      \n           His passion, full contact fighting. His goal, fulfill a        \n           lifelong dream of becoming a professional fighter. Ringo       \n           has put off attempts at a professional career for so long      \n           he has nearly succumbed to age. When the Extreme Cage          \n           Fighting(ECF) league, the preeminent full contact              \n           fighting promoters, announce a competition to select the       \n           best undiscovered fighter, Ringo's friends urge him to         \n           join. Ringo, once again, claims he is not ready. Even          \n           KARA, Ringo's love interest, pushes him to join, but           \n           Ringo resists. Seeing his skill and desire to become a         \n           professional she surprises him with a last minute visit        \n           to the ECF: Undiscovered registration. Eight fighters          \n           will be selected. Thousands submit and the chances of          \n           making the cut are slim. One day, at Ringo's local             \n           training gym, the ECF owner and current heavyweight            \n           champion enter the gym followed by a camera crew.              \n           Christopher watches Ringo practicing. Christopher, aware       \n           of Ringo's mother, chats with Ringo and ends up putting        \n           on the gloves for a quick spar. Ringo knocks him down as       \n           the cameras roll and it ends up on sports news shows           \n           across the nation. Will he fulfill his life long dream         \n           and continue his mothers legacy? Will he be the best           \n           fighter in the world?                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                    \n                        \n                            \n                                 \n                                                                          \n           Hector Echavarria.......... : ................Ringo Duran      \n           Rashad Evans............... : ........Christopher Holland      \n           Steven Yaffee.............. : .......................Link      \n           Keith Jardine.............. : ......................Stone      \n           Heath Herring.............. : ..................Demoledoe      \n           Nicholas Campbell.......... : ....................Raphael      \n           Jordan Madley.............. : .......................Kara      \n           Pedro Miguel Arce.......... : ..................Big Eddie      \n           Anna Cyzon................. : ............Emily Bradimore      \n           Tig Fong................... : ......................Razer      \n           Monique Ganderton.......... : ...............Gracie Duran      \n           Forrest Griffin............ : .............Gregor Popoff.      \n           Ashleigh Hubbard........... : .....................Pepper      \n           Lyoto Machida.............. : ...................Kamikaze      \n           Tony Nappo................. : ................Ref Dangelo      \n           James Preston Rogers....... : ....Sandor 'Fingers' Duarte      \n           Al Sapienza................ : .....................Sergio      \n                                                                          \n                                                                      \n                      \n                             \n                       \n         \n                                                                        \n                                                                            \n                  Thanks to our friends at KART3LDVD.
