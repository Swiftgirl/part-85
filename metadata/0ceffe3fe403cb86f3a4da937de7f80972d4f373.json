First, his soon-to-be floor manager acquires a serious injury in a machine malfunctioning accident that subsequently endangers the wellbeing of his company. Second, his personal life doesn't fair much better when he takes the advice of his bartending friend Dean during a drug-induced brainstorming session on how to test his wife's faithfulness. Finally, compounding these catastrophes is new employee Cindy, who happens to be a scam artist intent on milking the company for all its worth. Now, Joel must attempt to piece his company and his marriage back together all while trying to figure out what he's really after in life.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ceffe3fe403cb86f3a4da937de7f80972d4f373","amp;dn":"Extract.2009.CUSTOM.PT.SUBS.NTSC.DVDR-TUGA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ceffe3fe403cb86f3a4da937de7f80972d4f373","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,239,254,63,228,3,203,134,243,164,218,147,125,231,248,9,114,212,243,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
