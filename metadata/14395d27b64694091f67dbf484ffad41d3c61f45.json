It would stand out in almost any other musician's canon (or even in a different era of Rollins' career).\n\nDuring the 60s Sonny kept expanding his style with almost every album, showing his capacities. He kept recording over the next decades, even appearing on the Rolling Stones' Tattoo You album in 1981 (Slave and Waiting On A Friend).\n\nOriginal LP Tracks: Disc One: Decision; Bluesnote; How Are Things in Glocca Morra? Disc Two: Plain Jane; Sonnysphere.\n\n\nPersonnel: Sonny Rollins, saxophone; Donald Byrd, trumpet; Wynton Kelly, piano; Gene Ramey, bass; Max Roach, drums.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14395d27b64694091f67dbf484ffad41d3c61f45","amp;dn":"Sonny+Rollins+Sonny+Rollins+Vol+1%28jazz%29%28flac%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14395d27b64694091f67dbf484ffad41d3c61f45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,57,93,39,182,70,148,9,31,103,219,244,132,255,173,65,211,198,31,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
