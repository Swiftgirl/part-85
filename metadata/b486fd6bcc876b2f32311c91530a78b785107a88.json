Some of us will come again to this journey to renew and refresh and then to delve deeper into the mystery that waits for us there. Others of us will come for the first time, and amid the amazing and entertaining, we will discover so much more of ourselves. We can all become so much more. Again or for the first time, as we work with Merlin and his magic, we can learn so much more about our magic and about the magicians we truly are. As we work with Arthur and his dreams, we can learn so much more of our dreams and of the dreamers/dream-weavers that we are destined to be.\n\nThis recording includes excerpts from several of the Lazaris workshops about the Arthurian Legends and about the Merlin-Arthur Legacy of Love. We can work with Merlin and Arthur and with their love as well as with our love. We can explore the uncharted together with Lazaris as our guide. We can journey with Merlin and Arthur deeper into the mystery. They will become more as we do. They will engage the magic for themselves as we engage it for ourselves. The spiritual current - that current that can guide and accompany us ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œall the wayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Home -- can come alive in us as though electric. We can know in ways we have never known; we can be in ways that we have never been. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://shop.lazaris.com/Merlin-Arthur_Legacy_Part_1__P268C50.cfm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://shop.lazaris.com/Merlin-Arthur_Legacy_Part_1__P268C50.cfm&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://shop.lazaris.com/Merlin-Arthur_Legacy_Part_2__P369C50.cfm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://shop.lazaris.com/Merlin-Arthur_Legacy_Part_2__P369C50.cfm&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b486fd6bcc876b2f32311c91530a78b785107a88","amp;dn":"Lazaris+-+Legacy+of+Merlin+Arthur%2C+1%262","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b486fd6bcc876b2f32311c91530a78b785107a88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,134,253,107,204,135,107,47,50,49,28,145,83,10,120,183,133,16,122,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
