She is, however, too charmed by the adorable young boy to want to press the issue.\n\nAnn starts to see the figures of a man and woman around the grounds of the estate. The figures come and go at will without ever being seen or challenged by other members of the household, and they seem to Ann to be supernatural.\n\nShe learns that her predecessor, Miss Jessel (Katie Lightfoot) and her illicit lover Peter Quint (Edward MacLiam), another former servant of the household, a clever but abusive man, both died under curious circumstances. Prior to their death, they spent most of their time with Flora and Miles, and this fact takes on a grim significance for Ann when she becomes convinced that the two children are secretly aware of the presence of the ghosts.\n\nAnn soon becomes obsessed with the belief that malevolent forces are stalking the children in her care, manipulating Miles and Flora and even using them to continue their relationship from beyond the grave. Ann determines to save her charges from these supernatural beings, but this comes at huge cost to herself and her sanity.\n\nThe Turn Of The Screw was commissioned by Ben Stephenson and Jay Hunt, Controller of BBC One, and is executive produced by Jessica Pope (Hunter, Sense And Sensibility), produced by Colin Wratten (Waking The Dead, EastEnders) and directed by Tim Fywell (The No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency).\n\nOriginally published in 1898, the short novel was written by US-born British author Henry James.\n\nFilming begins in August on location in the West Country.\n\nBBC Drama Production is a world leader in producing much-loved and critically acclaimed dramas, including The 39 Steps, Criminal Justice, Cranford, Lark Rise To Candleford, Emma, Survivors, Tess Of The D'Urbervilles, House Of Saddam and Little Dorrit.\n\nInformation for viewers\n\nMore content about The Turn Of The Screw will be published, as transmission approaches, on this page:\nwww.bbc.co.uk/tv/comingup/theturnofthescrew\n\n.:Screenshots:.\n Visit this link: http://img693.Imageshack.us/img693/6263/theturnofthescrewavi.th.jpg\n  \n.:Tech Sheet:.\n[ Info sul file ]\n\nNome: The Turn Of The Screw.avi\nData: 7/01/2010 00:29:09\nDimensione: 731,494,400 bytes (697.607 MB)\n\n[ Info generiche ]\n\nDurata: 01:28:35 (5315 s)\nTipo di contenitore: AVI OpenDML\nStreams totali: 2\nTipo stream n. 0: video\nTipo stream n. 1: audio\nAudio streams: 1\nISFT: VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\nJUNK: VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n\n[ Giudizi sulla qualitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  ]\n\nRisoluzione: ALTA (624 x 352)\nLarghezza: multipla di 16 (BENE)\nAltezza: multipla di 32 (BENE)\nQualitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  DRF medio: MEDIA (3.547574)\nQualitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  deviazione standard: MEDIA (0.961121)\nMedia pesata dev. std.: ALTA (0.438359)\n\n[ Traccia video ]\n\nFourCC: xvid/XVID\nRisoluzione: 624 x 352\nDisplay aspect ratio: 39:22 = 1.772727 (~16:9)\nFramerate: 25 fps\nFrames totali: 132875\nBitrate: 961.006818 kbps\nQf: 0.175008\nMax key int: 300\n\n[ Traccia audio ]\n\nAudio tag: 0x55 (MP3)\nBitrate: 127.104 kbps VBR\nCanali: 2\nFrequenza: 48000 Hz\nStream size: 84,444,288 bytes\nRitardo: 0 ms\n\n[ Info sulla codifica MPEG4 ]\n\nUser data: XviD0050\nPacked bitstream: No\nInterlaced: No\nAspect ratio: Square pixels\nQuant type: H.263\nFrames totali: 132875\nFrames corrotti: 0\n\nI-VOPs:  1564 (  1.177 %)                          \nP-VOPs: 47691 ( 35.892 %) #########                \nB-VOPs: 83620 ( 62.931 %) ################         \n\nMax consecutive B-VOPs: 2\n    1 consec:  8802 ( 19.047 %) #####                    \n    2 consec: 37409 ( 80.953 %) ####################     \n\n[ Analisi DRF ]\n\nDRF medio: 3.547574\nDeviazione standard: 0.961121\nDRF max: 5\n\nDRF=1:    15 (  0.011 %)                          \nDRF=2: 27818 ( 20.935 %) #####                    \nDRF=3: 21485 ( 16.169 %) ####                     \nDRF=4: 66507 ( 50.052 %) #############            \nDRF=5: 17050 ( 12.832 %) ###                      \nDRF&gt;5:     0 (  0.000 %)                          \n\nRapporto generato da  Visit this link:(26-05-2007) in data  8 gen 2010, h 11:27:30\n  \n    7g/7 a 20k salvo inconvenienti fino ai primi 50 completi\n\n\nVisit http://www.tntvillage.scambioetico.org/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a08bc8d1c3e57196923755a5be6bd4e312a5efb","amp;dn":"%5BXviD+-+Eng+Mp3+-+Sub+Ita+Eng%5D+The+Turn+Of+The+Screw+%5BTntvillage","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a08bc8d1c3e57196923755a5be6bd4e312a5efb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,8,188,141,28,62,87,25,105,35,117,90,91,230,189,78,49,42,94,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
