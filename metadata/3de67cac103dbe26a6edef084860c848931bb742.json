Details on the alleged perpetrator are just emerging, but it all seems to be sadly in line with the sort of pathological behavior thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been manifesting itself with more frequency lately. There are several ways to deal with paranoid extremism. Unfortunately, one of them seems to be to use paranoid extremism. In a perfect example of making things worse, the Sheriff of Bossier Parish, Louisiana has created a parish emergency operations plan that seems to rely mostly on giving guns to overweight middle-aged white ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œvolunteers.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½   Video from the sheriff departmentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ own website shows what appears to be a gathering of exclusively pudgy white guys being shown the rudiments of what parish Chief Deputy of Support Services Doyle Dempsey calls ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œuse of force continuumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ while they peruse a virtual arsenal of weaponry to be put at their disposal. Really? This is their plan in case of an emergency? I think thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to most peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a situation where a bunch of poorly trained rednecks are given lethal weapons constitutes an emergency. Yes, a hurricane can be devastating. A terrorist attack could be very damaging. But neither one is likely to be as harmful as mobs of rampaging rednecks with machine guns. Nice going, Bossier Parish. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve created a plan to respond to a natural disaster with a manmade disaster. So what happened here? Somebody was tasked with coming up with an emergency response plan, and decided the best idea would be to give automatic weapons to the cast of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDeliverance.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Great idea, if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re being invaded by Ned Beatty. The plan is called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOperation Exodus.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Nice choice. One look at these volunteers, and I would be planning a hasty exodus from Bossier Parish myself. Their website says ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOperation ExodusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was chosen for the Biblical reference in which ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦the Israelites were totally on their own, learning to be self-sufficient and handle everything aloneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ OK. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m no Bible scholar, but as I remember Exodus, the Israelites were carrying unleavened bread, not automatic weapons. And besidesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½take another look at the Bible. The Israelites were running away! Or is your plan that, in the event of a terrorist attack, you flee and wander the desert for 40 years?\n\nAs we see from todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s news, there are plenty of loose cannons out there. Our response shouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be to set more cannons loose.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3de67cac103dbe26a6edef084860c848931bb742","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+March+05+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3de67cac103dbe26a6edef084860c848931bb742","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,230,124,172,16,61,190,38,166,237,239,8,72,96,200,72,147,27,183,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
