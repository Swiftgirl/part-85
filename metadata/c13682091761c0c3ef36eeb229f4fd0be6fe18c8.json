The B-52s' sound is marked by the vocals ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the female harmonies of Cindy Wilson and Kate Pierson, and the generally spoken-word or sprechgesang male vocal counterpoint of Fred Schneider, Ricky Wilson's surf style guitar and Keith Strickland's go go beat drumming. The resulting unique &quot;guy vs. gals&quot; vocals, sometimes used in call and response style (as in their songs &quot;Private Idaho&quot; and &quot;Good Stuff&quot;), are a trademark of the band. Presenting as a positive, enthusiastic, slightly wacky party band, the B-52s have focused on songs telling tall tales (&quot;Rock Lobster&quot;, &quot;Girl from Ipanema Goes to Greenland&quot;), glorifying wild youth (&quot;Love Shack&quot;, &quot;Deadbeat Club&quot;), or celebrating wild romance (&quot;Strobe Light&quot;, &quot;Hot Pants Explosion&quot;), all set to a danceable New Wave beat.\n\nThe band's name comes from a particular beehive hairdo resembling the nose cone of the aircraft of the same name. Keith Strickland suggested the name after a dream he had one night, of a band performing in a hotel lounge. In the dream he heard someone whisper in his ear that the name of the band was &quot;The B-52s.&quot; During their early years, wigs of that style were often worn by the band's female singers Cindy Wilson and Kate Pierson. The correct name for the band had long been &quot;The B-52's&quot;, but in 2008 they dropped the apostrophe, with their official website and Funplex album and single covers reading &quot;The B-52s&quot;. In a June 2009 interview with the Arizona Daily Star Schneider said that band will hereafter be known without its apostrophe.\n\n\n\nTracklist\n\nTrism (Riton Remix) 6:25  \nSong For A Future Generation (Majortweaks Remix) 6:04  \nWhammy Kiss (MHC Remix) 6:43  \nLegal Tender (Majortweaks Remix) 5:58 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c13682091761c0c3ef36eeb229f4fd0be6fe18c8","amp;dn":"The+B-52s+%5B2005%5D+Whammy+%21+%282005+remix+EP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c13682091761c0c3ef36eeb229f4fd0be6fe18c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,54,130,9,23,97,192,195,239,54,238,178,41,244,253,11,230,254,24,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
