It was control of the sea       \n    rather than her land empire that was the key to           \n    Britain's growing wealth.                                  \n                                                              \n    Technological advances saw Britain and France engage in  \n    an arms race over battleships. While Britain's navy       \n    appeared to be winning, the meritocracy fostered in        \n    Nelson's time was slowly being eroded by an entrenched    \n    hierarchy which smothered any spark of initiative among  \n    its sailors.                                              \n                                                               \n    When Germany emerged as a new threat, modernising         \n    admiral Jackie Fisher was called to reform the Navy.     \n    Fisher believed in peace through deterrence and had       \n    plans for a huge new battleship - the Dreadnought.         \n                                                              \n    When war finally came, the British and German fleets     \n    clashed off Jutland in 1916. But the outcome was not      \n    the knock-out blow the British public wanted. Britain      \n    emerged from World War I victorious but broke, and no     \n    longer able to maintain by far the world's largest       \n    fleet. In time, other nations eclipsed her. It was the    \n    end of centuries of naval supremacy.                       \n                                                              \n                                                                \n      \n\n      \n            .  . ..: RiPPER/RELEASE NOTES :.. .  .           \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n      \n\n                                             \n                  ..: GROUP NEWS/CONTACT :..  \n                                                           \n                                                      \n       SFM is dedicated to bringing you high quality     \n      TVRips and DVDRips of popular series and movies for   \n                     your viewing pleasure!                 \n                                                           \n       We are currently looking for:                       \n       - 100+ Mbit EU dump site for exclusive SFM usage   \n       - HDTV/PDTV cappers                                \n       - Crates &amp; Kegs of Beer (full of course)          \n                                                         \n                  .  . ..: GREETZ :.. .  .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e985f52f3b9a561769f0ab614d0f0c6d7aef43da","amp;dn":"Empire.of.the.Seas.How.the.Navy.Forged.the.Modern.World.S01E04.7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e985f52f3b9a561769f0ab614d0f0c6d7aef43da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,133,245,47,59,154,86,23,105,240,171,97,77,15,12,109,122,239,67,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
