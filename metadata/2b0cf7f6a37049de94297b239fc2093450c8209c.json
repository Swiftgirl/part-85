Lost In The Flames\n2. Synasthesia\n3. Gravity\n4. Inside My Head\n5. The Concept Of Infinity\n6. Still Life\n7. Phantoms\n8. Incomplete Sanity\n9. Reflections\n\nThe debut album that started it all. Shattersphere's signature sonic quality captured in 9 tracks. From the brutal ear-piercing assault &quot;Lost In The Flames&quot; to the epic orchestral masterpiece &quot;Reflections,&quot; the band is able to invoke an emotional rollercoaster among their audience. \n\n&quot;Metal, metal, metal from Connecticut, this four piece definetly brings out their own unique sound in the 9 song CD. My favorite song, 'The Concept of Infinity&quot;, is all instrumental and features an awesome keyboard sound and interesting drum fills that makes you want to put the whole thing on replay.&quot;\n\n- MaximumMetal.com\n\nAlbum Credits\n\nProduced, Engineered, and Mixed by Ron Zabrocki\nMastered by Tim Conklin\nAll songs written and performed by Shattersphere\nRecorded at Zabrocki Digital \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b0cf7f6a37049de94297b239fc2093450c8209c","amp;dn":"Shattersphere+-+Shattersphere+%5B2004%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b0cf7f6a37049de94297b239fc2093450c8209c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,12,247,246,163,112,73,222,148,41,123,35,159,194,9,52,80,200,32,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
