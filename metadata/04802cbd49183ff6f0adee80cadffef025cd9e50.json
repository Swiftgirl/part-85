From this\nperiod date the symphonies 0 and 1 as well as these\nmasses. Bruckner had not yet fully developed the processes\nthat would allow him to explore the vast, slow time-scales of\nhis later works. But, though the masses owe much in\ntheir ground-plans to the masses of Mozart, Schubert and\nHaydn, they also employ a principle of cyclical re-use of\nmaterial that is rather symphonic in nature. It could be\nargued that these masses as well as the early symphonies\nare the crucible in which Bruckner would forge his later style.\nAnd, perhaps, this goes some way to explaining the lack of\nrecordings in the catalogue. For a successful conductor of\nthese works must not only be sympathetic to the pre-existing\nmasses of the classical period but must have a grasp\nof Brucknerian structure. &quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04802cbd49183ff6f0adee80cadffef025cd9e50","amp;dn":"Bruckner+-+The+Masses+-+Bavarian+Radio+Orch.+Choir+-+E.+Jochum","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04802cbd49183ff6f0adee80cadffef025cd9e50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,128,44,189,73,24,63,246,240,173,238,128,202,223,254,240,37,205,158,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
