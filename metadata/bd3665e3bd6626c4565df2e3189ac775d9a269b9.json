Unfortunately, I only have the Sprint ones, so this won't work for the Pre Plus on Verizon, any of the other carriers, or on the Pixi or Pixi Plus.\n\nThat being said, apparently some people have wanted older versions in the past.\n\nThis includes:\n\n\n1.1.0\n1.2.0\n1.2.1\n1.3.1\n1.3.5\n1.3.5.1\n1.4.0\n\n\n\nJust one more thing I wanted to add to the description, feel free to check the MD5sums against what's listed on webOS-internals, to make sure it won't mess up your phone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd3665e3bd6626c4565df2e3189ac775d9a269b9","amp;dn":"Palm+Pre+webOS+Doctor+Files+%28Sprint+Only%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd3665e3bd6626c4565df2e3189ac775d9a269b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,54,101,227,189,102,38,196,86,93,242,227,24,154,199,117,217,162,105,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
