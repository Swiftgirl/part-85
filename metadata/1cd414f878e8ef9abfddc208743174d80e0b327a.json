It was originally released in 1974 with the title Barbra Streisand Featuring The Hit Single The Way We Were And All In Love Is Fair; the spine was labeled Barbra Streisand Featuring The Way We Were And All In Love Is Fair. The title has since been changed to The Way We Were and the cover art has had this title added. The album peaked at number 1 in the Billboard albums chart for two weeks and has been certified double platinum by the RIAA for sales of around 2,000,000.\n\nWilliam Ruhlmann, All Music Guide  - Though usually referred to as The Way We Were, the unwieldy full title of this album is &quot;Barbra Streisand Featuring the Hit Single The Way We Were and All in Love Is Fair,&quot; an important distinction because it was released simultaneously with the original soundtrack album for the film The Way We Were (Columbia 32830), which also contained a Streisand recording of the title song, along with the film score composed by Marvin Hamlisch. This album was thrown together quickly after that song took off as a single (in a recording different from the one in the film) in the wake of the success of the movie. In addition to the single and the Stevie Wonder song that also features in its title, the album contained a grab-bag of stray tracks dating back as far as seven years and coming from Streisand's fourth TV special, The Belle of 14th Street and an unfinished album project called &quot;The Singer&quot; largely made up of ballads written by Alan and Marilyn Bergman and Michel Legrand. The combined commercial impact of the film and the single propelled this album to the top of the charts. \n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Being At War With Each Other\n[02] Something So Right\n[03] The Best Thing You've Ever Done\n[04] The Way We Were\n[05] All In Love Is Fair\n[06] What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life?\n[07] Summer Me, Winter Me\n[08] Pieces Of Dreams\n[09] I've Never Been A Woman Before\n[10] My Buddy/How About Me (Medley)\n[11] The Way We Were \t&gt;(Soundtrack Version)\n \n\n\nTotal Play Time\t&gt; 00h:39m:05s\n\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 93.5mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes v7.5.0.20 MP3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\n\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Pop\n\nRelease Date\t&gt; January 1974\n\nRecord Company\t&gt; Columbia Sony Music\n\nArtist Website\t- \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.barbrastreisand.com/us/home&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.barbrastreisand.com/us/home&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sonymusic.com/artists/BarbraStreisand/career_film.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sonymusic.com/artists/BarbraStreisand/career_film.html&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.vh1.com/artists/az/barbra_streisand/artist.jhtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.vh1.com/artists/az/barbra_streisand/artist.jhtml&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbra_Streisand&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbra_Streisand&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.oldielyrics.com/b/barbra_streisand.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.oldielyrics.com/b/barbra_streisand.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cd414f878e8ef9abfddc208743174d80e0b327a","amp;dn":"%5B1974%5D+The+Way+We+Were+-+Barbra+Streisand+-+93mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cd414f878e8ef9abfddc208743174d80e0b327a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,212,20,248,120,232,239,154,191,221,194,8,116,49,116,216,14,11,50,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
