No Tools like Nlite is used. Our aim was to create a version which is fairly stable with no flashy content like the other modified Windows running around. Normal Nlite based modified Windows might show some problems when updating/repairing a current windows setup. So about RockStable - Though we got the final aim of having a pretty stable edition, it has just one problem - its huge size. But we feel that this will be worth it.\n\nCD-Key: J797T-WJPRH-KFKWV-HXKR9-FQGBB\t\n\nRegards,\nHoodiboY for RocksTeam\n\nFor further discussion/opinion/critcs come to &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://rocksteam.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://rocksteam.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:183b151bc896cdb025a30181ff22c9a3a82badeb","amp;dn":"Windows+2003+Server+Enterprise+x86+-+updated+upto+Nov+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"183b151bc896cdb025a30181ff22c9a3a82badeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,59,21,27,200,150,205,176,37,163,1,129,255,34,201,163,168,43,173,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
