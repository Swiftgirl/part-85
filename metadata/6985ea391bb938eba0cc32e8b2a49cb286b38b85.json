The evil deity Hellgaia has escaped from his tomb and threatens to destroy NeverlandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s existence. The shrine guardian summons the Dominators, those who wield the power of the spectral cards ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ to help. Eleven are sent, but only one has the strength to prevail - Galahad.\n\nArmed with the power to summon allied warriors and creatures, cast powerful spells, and build resourceful bases with his Spectral Cards, guide Galahad on his quest to stop Hellgaia and save the world. The other dominators await, each with their own card-wielding ways. Think you have what it takes to be a true card master?
