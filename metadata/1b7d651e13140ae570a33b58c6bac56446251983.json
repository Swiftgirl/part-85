Its basically a collection of 30 or so songs that did not make it on my studio album. The music industry has destroyed independent music, and has removed artistry and replaced it with advertising and sex. This is our response.\n\nIf you enjoy this album thank you, we do not want your money.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b7d651e13140ae570a33b58c6bac56446251983","amp;dn":"The+Grey+Agenda+-+Unknown-+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b7d651e13140ae570a33b58c6bac56446251983","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,125,101,30,19,20,10,229,112,163,59,88,198,186,197,100,70,37,25,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
