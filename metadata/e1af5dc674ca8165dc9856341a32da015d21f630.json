Musically this has some great funk rock numbers such as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Give It UpÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, neat AOR rock like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Speech Of AngelsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ but it is the ballads that really make this album special. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“As You Turn AwayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ with Robert HartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s impassioned vocal and Eddie MartinezÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s stunning guitar solo ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ superb stuff! The title track again highlights HartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s emotive vocals with a sexy funk vibe rumbling under the music.\n\nTrack list:\n\n01 No way out\n\n02 Leave it up to you\n\n03 Speech of angels\n\n04 As you turn away\n\n05 Give it up\n\n06 Under the one sky\n\n07 Rescue me\n\n08 Looking over your shoulder\n\n09 Everytime I stand up\n\n10 Softly speak\n\n11 Stand up\n\n12 I Hear You\n\nBand:\n\nBernard Edwards (CHIC/THE POWERSTATION) bass\n\nTony Thompson (CHIC/THE POWERSTATION) drums\n\nRobert Hart lead vocals\n\nEddie Martinez (MEATLOAF) guitar\n\nJeff Bova (MEATLOAF) keyboards","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1af5dc674ca8165dc9856341a32da015d21f630","amp;dn":"Distance+-+Under+The+One+Sky+%28320kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1af5dc674ca8165dc9856341a32da015d21f630","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,175,93,198,116,202,129,101,220,152,86,52,26,50,218,1,93,33,246,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
