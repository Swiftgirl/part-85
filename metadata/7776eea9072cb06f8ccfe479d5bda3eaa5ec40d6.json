Take this adorable trifle directed by William Wyler\nwith Audrey looking glorious in her trademark Givenchy clothing. Audrey could have phone in a performance, but she's totally enchanting \nas always, making us overlook the seams in the script. \nShe's beautifully supported by Peter O'Toole, who never looked handsomer or more Cary Grant-ish in his life as Simon, the art\nexpert who gets talked into stealing Audrey's father's statue of the Cellini Venus back from the museum when it is learned the statue\nhas to be authenticated for insurance purposes. \nHugh Griffith, as Audrey's father, is a delightful rogue of an art forger and Charles Boyer and Eli Wallach just add to the fun. The\nactual theft of the statue is quite ingenious, if a little too drawn out. \nStill, here's two hours of pure enchantment. That Ferrari still looks good nearly forty years later, and if Audrey was walking down Fifth\nAvenue, dressed in Givenchy's stunning creations today, she'd cause a riot. Check out that lace cocktail dress with the matching\nlace mask at the bar of the Ritz in Paris! It doesn't get any chicer than this.
