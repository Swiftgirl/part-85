This time however, when writing &quot;Still Not Getting Any...&quot;, the members of Simple Plan were noted as saying that they were not limiting themselves to the punk genre, but rather letting themselves write &quot;good music&quot;.\n\nAccording to the bonus DVD of Still Not Getting Any..., while making the CD the members of Simple Plan thought of many names including &quot;Get Rich or Die Trying&quot; and &quot;Danger Zone&quot;. They decided on the name Still Not Getting Any... for a list of explained reasons. The most popular and most likely reason is because the members of Simple Plan thought that they weren't getting any good reviews, Bouvier once noting that they only had one recent good review in Alternative Press. Another reason may be because they were still not getting any respect. There are many more variations the band members have given, as anything can really be put after the ellipsis, including &quot;better&quot;, &quot;smarter&quot;, &quot;funnier&quot;, and the obvious sexual connotation. Comeau once described the name of the album as &quot;versatile&quot;.\n\n&quot;Still Not Getting Any...&quot; showed a dramatic change in Simple Plan's style as well. They still kept their style of downbeat lyrics matched to upbeat music, but managed to transcend from the standard pop-punk genre. Although many of the tracks on this CD still carry the feeling of teen angst that is probably most noticeable in the song &quot;I'm Just a Kid&quot; from the first album No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls, the general slant of this album tends toward slightly deeper and more mature lyrical themes, as well as a more mainstream sound that edges away from the pure pop-punk style of their last album. Some critics have pointed towards the inclusion of 'classic' or 'mainstream' rock elements, claiming the album 'de-emphasizes punk-pop hyperactivity in favor of straightforward, well-crafted modern rock'.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb6e8e8dfc8719ef1002a3b1ca079370f8940798","amp;dn":"Simple+Plan+-+Still+Not+Getting+Any...+%282004%29+%5BLossless%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb6e8e8dfc8719ef1002a3b1ca079370f8940798","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,110,142,141,252,135,25,239,16,2,163,177,202,7,147,112,248,148,7,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
