It had seemed like the perfect getaway for Malibu's famous TV private investigator, Mac Reilly and his girlfriend/partner, Sunny Alvarez, along with his three-legged, one-eyed rescue dog Pirate, and her snippy three-pound fiend on four paws, the chihuahua, Tesoro. But now they find themselves having to sort out the misfits' lives, including two lonely children on the trail of the mystery, solve crime, and a murder, all against the sunny, glamorous backdrop of St. Tropez. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38a9fd5cd4b40b2d8248fb801b945ff9a0d698c7","amp;dn":"Adler%2C+Elizabeth+-+There%5C%27s+Something+About+St+Tropez","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38a9fd5cd4b40b2d8248fb801b945ff9a0d698c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,169,253,92,212,180,11,45,130,72,251,128,27,148,95,249,160,214,152,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
