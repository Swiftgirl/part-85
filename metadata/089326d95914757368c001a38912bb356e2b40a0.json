Having paid attention to the adult services advertised both in the Dallas Observer and the Fort Worth Weekly, I was curious how such blatant public displays of illegal behavior were accomplished. I thought it would make for a good production project for my class. I was aware of the ethical, logistical, and legal snares that would be encountered in covering such a subject (especially considering the necessary intimate proximity one would have to achieve in order to tell the story accurately.) I knew there were numerous lurid parts of the story that couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be told. But, I was becoming more and more interested in another genre: the mockumentary. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s where creativity and venality can run free.\n\nSo, ten years later, I approach my good friend Angela Gant, Phd. with a proposal: BackPage.\n\nIn March of 2008 we assembled thirty seven actors, twenty extras, a dozen support personnel, and met for week of insanity. Over the next twelve days, we shot for seven half-days, two golden-OT days, and three days of setup and strike. We utilized every format we could get our hands on: HDV, DVCAM, VHS, Hi8, MPG4, Camera ObscuraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nThe resulting film exceeds my wildest dreams. The experience was life altering. I am so impressed with the friends and colleagues I know. Their camaraderie and creativity are an inspiration to me. I canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t thank them enough.\n\nSo, look for our effort at various film festivals across the country over the next year.\n\nThank You,\n\nRichard Massey\n\nNo whores were harmed during the making of this film.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:089326d95914757368c001a38912bb356e2b40a0","amp;dn":"BackPage+the+Movie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"089326d95914757368c001a38912bb356e2b40a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,147,38,217,89,20,117,115,104,192,1,163,137,18,187,53,110,43,64,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
