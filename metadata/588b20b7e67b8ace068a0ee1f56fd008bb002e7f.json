Teaming up with Europol investigator Mika, Raizo steadily butchers his enemies while inching ever closer to the long-awaited bloody reunion with his former master.\n\nWhen several people are killed in a peculiar manner, a Europol agent suspects that it could be the work of Ninja assassins. Her superiors warn her that she's entering dangerous territory. But she investigates nonetheless and it leads her to another dead agent who was also investigating the same thing. When she is marked for death, she is saved by another Ninja, whom she learns has gone renegade.\n\nCast: Sung Kang, Randall Duk Kim, Ben Miles, Rain\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n                                              000000\n                                            0000000000\n                                          000000   00000\n                   000000               000000      000000\n                 0000000000            00000          00000\n               000000   00000         00000            00000\n              00000       00000      00000              00000\n             00000                   0000                0000\n00000000   00000                     0000                0000\n00000000   00000                     0000                0000\n00000000   00000                     0000                0000\n00000000    00000                    0000                0000\n              00000                  0000                0000\n               0000000               0000                0000\n                 000000000           0000                0000\n00000000              000000         0000                0000\n00000000                00000        0000                0000\n00000000                 00000       0000                0000\n00000000                  00000      0000                0000\n00000000                  00000      0000                0000\n00000000                  00000      0000                0000\n00000000                 00000       0000                0000\n00000000   00000        00000        0000                0000\n00000000    00000      00000         0000                0000\n00000000      00000   00000          0000                0000\n00000000        000000000            00000              00000\n00000000          00000               000000          000000\n00000000                               000000        000000\n                                         000000    000000\n                                           000000000000\n                                             00000000","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:588b20b7e67b8ace068a0ee1f56fd008bb002e7f","amp;dn":"Ninja.Assassin%5B2009%5D++iSO+Man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"588b20b7e67b8ace068a0ee1f56fd008bb002e7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,139,32,183,230,123,138,206,6,138,14,225,245,111,208,8,187,0,46,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
