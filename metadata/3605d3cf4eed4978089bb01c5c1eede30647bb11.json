This is not my work, but I have used it on alt of Wii systems and have had no trouble at all.Please read the READ 1st file before starting to softmod your wii. Follow ALL instructions and Enjoy afterwards. This is a very easy guide to follow. The USB loader actually lets you copy Origianl Wii games to an external hard drive, then you no longer need a disk to play them. And you can easily burn them to a back up disk so you dont scratch up the original. You will be able to play backups of your games on disk or on external drive, your choice there. Have fun and have a great day.\n\nYes, this is my first upload, so I hope it goes well.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3605d3cf4eed4978089bb01c5c1eede30647bb11","amp;dn":"softmod+guide+for+4.2U+wii","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3605d3cf4eed4978089bb01c5c1eede30647bb11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,5,211,207,78,237,73,120,8,155,176,28,92,30,237,227,6,71,187,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
