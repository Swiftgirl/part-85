It can be used together with Semantic Maps, which adds semantic capabilities to the mapping services, but can also be used without it on non-semantic wiki's. Both Maps and Semantic Maps are based on Semantic Google Maps and Semantic Layers, and are meant to replace those extensions. Maps contains all functionality of Google Geocoder, and so also replaces this extension.
