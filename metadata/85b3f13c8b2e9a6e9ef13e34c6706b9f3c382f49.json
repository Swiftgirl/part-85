This also includes a few files ( I have not tried any of the others) that may help you with your emulator.\nYou may also experience crashes with this crack if u have the sound turned off.\n\n-Extract firmware/bios files to no$gba folder\n-Put ROM in encrypt folder\n-Run encrypter\n-Press 1\n\n-Run no$gba and open the (now encrypted) ROM\n-AS SOON AS THE FILE BOX CLOSES (while the screens are still white)\nopen the emulation options (F11) and change the option under\n&quot;Reset/Startup Entrypoint&quot; to GBA BIOS. After hitting OK,\nimmediately reset the game (numpad *). If you did it right, you'll\nsee the DS menu as you would on a real DS. Play it normally from there.\nIf you reset too late, or use an unencrypted ROM, it will crash.\n\nMake sure the save type is set to automatic (2.6a).\n\nThis should work with any $gba emulator.\n\nYou can also find an already patched version of both games that I have uploaded.\n\nHope this helps anyone who has had the same crashing issues I have had.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85b3f13c8b2e9a6e9ef13e34c6706b9f3c382f49","amp;dn":"Pokemon+Soul+Silver+Heart+Gold+Crash+Fix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85b3f13c8b2e9a6e9ef13e34c6706b9f3c382f49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,179,241,60,139,46,154,110,158,241,62,52,198,112,107,159,60,56,47,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
