The other predicts economic ruin from trillion-dollar plans to re-order the global economy and redistribute the world's wealth.\n\nAs world leaders gathered at the Copenhagen conference on climate change, the controversy grew even hotter: Leaked e-mails cast doubt on the integrity of leading scientists; a cap-and-trade bill stalled in the Senate, and the Obama administration threatened an end-run around Congress.\n\nFox News unpacks this complicated, but hugely important story. It includes interviews with top United Nations climate officials, researchers who upset the global warming consensus and the U.S. lawmakers fighting it out on Capitol Hill.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe1e2bc75567c8bce4e6da585e08df219c1d5eaf","amp;dn":"Global.Warming...or.a.lot.of.Hot.Air.HDTV.XviD-BiLDeRBeRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe1e2bc75567c8bce4e6da585e08df219c1d5eaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,30,43,199,85,103,200,188,228,230,218,88,94,8,223,33,156,29,94,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
