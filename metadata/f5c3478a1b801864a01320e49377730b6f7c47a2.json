This is an unofficial remaster by myself, made purely for personal enjoyment.  However I am uploading the torrent here because I feel that both of the other versions available sound poor, and I have added some sympathetic mastering, made appropriate edits and rearranged the tracklist so that it makes for a better listen as an &quot;album&quot;.  I hope you enjoy this as much as I do, it's one of my favourite Sega Genesis soundtracks.\n\nGens HQ WAV dumps -&gt; post-processing/mastering by Vertiphon\n\nComposed by Norio Hanzawa &amp; Copyright 1993 Treasure.\nVertiphon 2010 remaster.\n\n\n01 Gunstar Introduction  2:21\n02 Legend Of The Gunstars  1:48\n03 Choose A Path  1:05\n04 Military On The Max Power (Stage 1)  2:24\n05 Stage Clear  0:11\n06 Rolling Chaser (Stage 2)  3:08\n07 Stairs Too High (Stage 3)  3:11\n08 Dance-Dice-Days (Stage 4)  2:17\n09 Decision  1:24\n10 Empire - The Final Assault (Stage 5)  2:41\n11 Good Night, Baby!
