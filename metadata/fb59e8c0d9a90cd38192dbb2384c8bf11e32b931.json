He devises a drug, that when applied to the eyes, enables the user to see beyond the normal realm of our sight (ultraviolet rays etc.) it also gives the user the power to see through objects. Xavier tests this drug on himself, when his funding is cut off. As he continues to test the drug on himself, Xavier begins to see, not only through walls and clothes, but through the very fabric of reality!  \n\n# To create the effect of being able to see through a building, the director filmed the construction of the building in time lapse, then ran the film backward.\n\n# It has long been rumored that a final scene, in which Dr. Xavier screams &quot;I can still see!&quot; was cut by censors. No footage of this is known. However, the movie does end rather abruptly just as Dr. Xavier seems about to say something, and those words would provide a chilling climax to the story. This rumor is false according to Corman - In a Q&amp;A with Corman he said this idea was discussed but never filmed.\n\n# This film originally had a five minute prologue about the human senses. This prologue was removed from all post-theatrical prints of the film, and may have been removed from some of the theatrical release prints. This reduced the running time to 79 minutes. The footage still exists.\n\nDirected by\nRoger Corman \n\nRay Milland\t    ... Dr. James Xavier\nDiana Van der Vlis  ...\tDr. Diane Fairfax\nHarold J. Stone\t    ...
