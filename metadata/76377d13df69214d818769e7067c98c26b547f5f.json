Survival horror as its never been seen before, The House of the Dead: OVERKILL is a pulp-style take on the best selling, classic SEGA light-gun shooter series. Back when the famous Agent G was fresh out of the academy, he teamed up with hard-boiled bad-ass Agent Washington to investigate stories of mysterious disappearances in small-town Louisiana. Little did they know what blood-soaked mutant horror awaited them in the streets and swamps of Bayou City.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76377d13df69214d818769e7067c98c26b547f5f","amp;dn":"The+House+of+the+Dead+Overkill+%5BPAL%5D+%5BWiiTorrentZ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76377d13df69214d818769e7067c98c26b547f5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,55,125,19,223,105,33,77,129,135,105,231,6,124,152,194,107,84,127,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
