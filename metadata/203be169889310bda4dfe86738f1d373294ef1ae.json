Farrell, who appeared for the full four hours, for a discussion on the connection between UFOs and the Nazi's Third Reich, and presented a very different scenario of what crashed in Roswell, New Mexico in July of 1947. &quot;If, two years after the end of World War II, something Nazi crashes in the New Mexico desert,&quot; he said, &quot;then, yes, that's going to get the American military to panic.&quot; This panic, Farrell believes, caused them to create the &quot;UFO v. weather balloon&quot; debate which has persisted to this day and, thus, pushed all other theories into the peripheral.\n\nHe detailed a number of issues surrounding the Roswell story which suggest that the downed craft was of terrestrial, but non-American, origin. For instance, Farrell noted that witnesses, who saw the Roswell debris, observed numbers on the wreckage. This, he surmised, suggests an Earthly origin since it is highly unlikely that ETs would be using our symbols for there numeric system. On the subject of the beings allegedly recovered from the crash, he asserted that, based on the vast majority of the accounts, there is &quot;nothing that compels to the fact that these were extraterrestrial beings. We simply have very odd looking humans.&quot; Apparently, this idea was shared by the Army personnel who arrived at the scene, since Farrell said that one witness claims that the recovery team attempted to speak Japanese and German to the crash victims.\n\nTaking these aspects of the event into account, Farrell advanced his alternative theory that the downed craft at Roswell was really a version of the erstwhile Nazi project known as The Bell. According to his research, work on the Bell can be traced from Germany to Argentina following World War II. To that end, he revealed that immediately following the Roswell crash, the US Army re-opened the security classification files of the former Nazis that were brought to America via Project Paperclip. Additionally, he cited the testimony of Col. Philip Corso, who Farrell contends, &quot;hints, repeatedly throughout his book, that there is some apparent Nazi 'look' to the technology that they had recovered.&quot; Ultimately, Farrell theorized that the displaced Nazis were &quot;sending a message to their former enemy that 'we have a technology that you cannot touch.'&quot; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:203be169889310bda4dfe86738f1d373294ef1ae","amp;dn":"C2C.March.14th.2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"203be169889310bda4dfe86738f1d373294ef1ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,59,225,105,136,147,16,189,164,223,232,103,56,241,211,115,41,78,241,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
