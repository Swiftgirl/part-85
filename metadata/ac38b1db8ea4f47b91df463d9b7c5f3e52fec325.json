As a result, TPB kept rejecting it saying it was already in the system. It probably was, just not anywhere it could be FOUND.\n\nOh well. Petty complaints, really.\n\nHave a happy new year and enjoy the selection of new music this month.\n\nSee you in Feb for the one year anniversary of Indie69 playlist torrents.\n\nA year already. wow.\n\nFor the list of files this month, look up a bit to the left. See where it says \n&quot;files:&quot; ? Click on the number &quot;75&quot; directly to the right. That will show you all the files/songs for this month. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac38b1db8ea4f47b91df463d9b7c5f3e52fec325","amp;dn":"Indie69+Jan+2010+Indie+Rock+Playlist+%28various+artists%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac38b1db8ea4f47b91df463d9b7c5f3e52fec325","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,56,177,219,142,164,244,123,145,223,70,61,155,124,95,62,82,254,195,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
