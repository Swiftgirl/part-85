Enjoy!\n\nPlaylist: The Very Best of Mariah Carey is a compilation album by American\npop/R&amp;B singer Mariah Carey. The album features some of Carey's released and\nunreleased songs (as singles) over the course of her career.\n\nThe album was released on January 26, 2010 as part of the Playlist music\nalbum series issued by Legacy Recordings\n\nThe album contains some of Mariah Carey's hits and singles, and also some\nsongs from her previous albums from her time at Columbia Records. It does not\nfeature any new material or include songs recorded with her current label,\nIsland Records, or her previous label, Virgin Records. It is a part of Sony\nLegacy's Playlist compilation albums series. Playlist: The Very Best of\n- Mariah Carey is a compilation of remastered original recordings by Mariah.\nThe playlist includes select greatest hits and some of Carey's favorite\ntracks that were not released as singles. The CD comes in eco-friendly\npackaging made of recyclable materials. A PDF file included on the CD\ncontains the song credits, photographs, and full liner notes. The difference\nin between Carey's previous greatest hits compilations and Playlist is that\nher previous ones had her most successful hits; Playlist had songs that in\nher opinion, were hits, meaning there were some non-singles included such as\n&quot;Underneath the Stars&quot; from Daydream, which she said was one of her favorite\nsongs by herself in the booklet of her 2009 album Memoirs of an Imperfect\nAngel. Even &quot;Outside&quot; from Butterfly was included.\n[IMG]http://i78.photobucket.com/albums/j81/wrcfoucs/watching3vemq8.gif[/IMG]\n\n[img]http://i121.photobucket.com/albums/o219/uuffoo/vghlr7.png[/img]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02e1c4c120c43fd2b6ec02c5bd8fc144bf3911b3","amp;dn":"Mariah+Carey+-+Playlist+The+Very+Best+Of+Mariah+Carey-%28Remastere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02e1c4c120c43fd2b6ec02c5bd8fc144bf3911b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,225,196,193,32,196,63,210,182,236,2,197,189,143,193,68,191,57,17,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
