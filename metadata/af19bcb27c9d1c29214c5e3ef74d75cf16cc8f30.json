After persuasion from his cousin Roman, who immigrated to America years prior to the game's opening, Niko leaves Eastern Europe[19] to come to Liberty City, where he hopes to forget his criminal past and pursue the American Dream. After his arrival, however, Niko quickly learns that Roman's tales of riches and luxury were lies concealing Roman's struggles with debt and gangsters. Niko aids Roman in his troubles while hoping to carve out a new life for himself in the city.\n\nIt is later revealed that one of the reasons Niko came to Liberty City was to search for the person he blames for the betrayal of his old army unit: Florian Cravic. Niko creates ties with the Liberty City Bratva through Roman's loan shark Vladimir Glebov and later makes acquaintance with a major figure of the Bratva, Mikhail Faustin and his associate, Dimitri Rascalov. Niko completes jobs for Faustin before joining Dimitri's plot to betray Faustin and take over the organization. Niko assassinates Faustin on Dimitri's orders, but is then betrayed by Dimitri himself. It is revealed that Dimitri is actually in collusion with Ray Bulgarin, a former employer of Niko who orders his men to kill him. Niko fights his way through the ambush with the help of Little Jacob, a Jamaican arms dealer whom Niko befriended earlier. Dimitri and Bulgarin escape, however, and Jacob suggests dealing with them later.\n\nGTA 4 Minimum System Requirements :\n===================================\n\n* Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo 1.8Ghz or equivalent AMD Athlon X2 64 2.4Ghz \n* Memory/RAM: 1GB for XP and 1.5GB for Vista \n* Video Card: 256MB NVIDIA 7900 or 256MB ATI X1900 \n* Hard Disk Space: 16GB free \n* Operating System: Windows XP SP3 or Windows Vista SP1 \n\nGTA 4 Recommended System Requirements :\n======================================== \n\n* Processor: Intel Core 2 Quad 2.4GHz or equivalent AMD Phenom X3 2.1GHz \n* Memory/RAM: 2.5 GB for XP or Vista \n* Video Card: 512MB NVIDIA 8600 or 512MB ATI 3870 \n* Hard Disk Space: 18GB free \n* Operating System: Windows XP SP3 or Windows Vista SP1\n\n\nTHANK YOU TO ALL THE PEOPLE THAT IN A INDIRECT WAY HELPED FOR THIS FILE BE POSSIBLE .\n\n\n\nFINALLY A PERFECT FILE FOR THE GTA IV GAME IS AVAILABLE AFTER ALL THIS TIME BUT IS BETTER LATER THEN NEVER ...\n\n\n\n***** enjoy ... *****\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af19bcb27c9d1c29214c5e3ef74d75cf16cc8f30","amp;dn":"PC+%C3%83%E2%80%9A%C3%82%C2%BB+GTA+IV+Basic+Gameplay+directplay+by+globe%40","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af19bcb27c9d1c29214c5e3ef74d75cf16cc8f30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,25,188,178,124,157,28,41,33,76,94,62,247,77,117,207,22,204,143,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
