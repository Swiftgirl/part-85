When he was a little kid, he used to play guitar and sing at the beaches in D??nia. He had also written a lot of songs and was even offered a record contract, but his parents decided he was too young for the music business and refused the offer. Several years later, in the Netherlands, Valensia used to play in some bands, usually on keyboard or guitar.\n\nInfluenced by Kate Bush and Queen, Valensia's self-titled first album (known as &quot;Gaia&quot; in Japan) contained the hit single &quot;Gaia&quot; that, out of nowhere, reached #2 in the Dutch charts and stayed in the charts for several weeks. &quot;Gaia&quot; had success in other countries too. The album itself spent almost 20 weeks in the album charts and had good critiques. Four singles were released: Gaia, The Sun, Nathalie and Tere.\n\n\nThis upload is the single Gaia and contains three songs\n- Gaia\n- 1997\n- My heart is in your hands\n\nThis is a copy of the original cd in WAV format\n\nenjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fce2559b0b3e1205b81d22ddcdbdc0c3b990c56","amp;dn":"Valensia+-++Gaia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fce2559b0b3e1205b81d22ddcdbdc0c3b990c56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,206,37,89,176,179,225,32,91,129,210,45,220,219,220,12,59,153,12,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
