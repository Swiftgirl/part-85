Judy Chu (D-CA) calls in 7:05am Pacific to talk about yesterdayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Toyota hearings on Capitol Hill.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Rep. Ron Kind (D-WI) calls in at 7:35am Pacific to talk about todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s health care reform summit.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ President Obama and his Dem allies are pleading their case for health care overhaul in an extraordinary summit with GOP-ers, broadcast live to a divided public on daytime TV. But Dems are already looking beyond TodayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s meeting at historic Blair House. With GOP lawmakers remaining steadfast in their opposition, the president and his party are preparing to move on alone.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Under blistering criticism, Toyota President Akio Toyoda personally and repeatedly apologized to Congress and millions of anxious American car-owners yesterday for deadly defects in popular models produced by his Japanese company. But angry lawmakers forcefully declared it was hardly enough.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Senate Dems have retreated from adding new privacy protections to the nationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s primary counterterrorism law. Lacking the necessary 60-vote supermajority, Dem leaders settled on a one-year extension of expiring surveillance and seizure provisions of the Patriot Act.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ A SeaWorld Orlando trainer was leisurely rubbing a killer whale from a poolside platform when the 12,000-pound creature reached up, grabbed her with its mouth and dragged her underwater.
