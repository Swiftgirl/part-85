Combine teabagging with a good backlash, and youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re starting to get major kinky. The nutcases are upset over BrownÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vote to break the Republican filibuster against a Senate jobs bill.  Scott! The teabaggers didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t elect you to provide jobs to the people of Massachusetts! Well actually, the teabaggers didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t elect you at all. The people of Massachusetts did. SoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦  carry on! I guess teabaggers arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t worried about jobs. They have jobs in the tea party graphic arts department, photoshopping President Obama into witch doctor costumes. Hey, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll always have a sign-making job with the tea party, as long as you can draw a proper swastika free hand. Yes, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a lot of anger against Scott Brown out there. Fortunately for him, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s way out thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as in Idaho and Arizona. Politically, Scott Brown would be in big troubleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½if teabaggers from Alabama, Wyoming, and Texas could vote in Massachusetts. Luckily for Scott, elderly white people from Kansas are not an important demographic in the Massachusetts Senate race. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s all part of this nutty movement to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpurifyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the Republican Party. TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re going to distill conservatism right down to its essence, which is evidently two parts fat from Rush LimbaughÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s neck and one part foam from the mouth of Glenn Beck. The hardcore conservatives are actually trying to create a smaller tent for the Republican Party. I think they have something like a three-man tent in mind. The problem is that, if Rush Limbaugh is one of those men, he fills up the three-man tent on his own. Well, I guess thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s always room for Ann Coulter. You can put her in the bag that the tentpoles come in.\n\nOf course, today is also Health Summit Eve, and the Republicans are busy decorating.  The Congressional Republicans have been whining about the details and visual set up of the healthcare summit. They want to make sure that everything looks perfect, so that nobody will notice how bad their healthcare proposals soundÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ that is, assuming they come up with some actual healthcare proposals by tomorrow. The GOP insisted that President Obama not get a podium. Then they insisted that he couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t sit at the head of a U-shaped table. The Republicans have put more thought into what the decor at the healthcare summit should be than theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve put into healthcare reform itself. Hey Republicans, let us take care of healthcare. You can knit a nice cozy for it.
