This is what I use.\nVLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.\nOne can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.\nQuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.\nPS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.\nAnd please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).Many of movies I encode have embedded subtitles. So far, only VLC player is able to use them correctly.\n\nUSE TORRENT-SEARCH SITES, TorrentBar extension for FireFox OR EVEN GOOGLE: show-name H264\n(for example GOSSIP GIRL H264).\n\n&quot;Home&quot; of my torrents (for Bookmark/Favorites in your browser) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty&lt;/a&gt;\n\nInteresting &quot;Discussion&quot; to follow: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5191311/Cloudy.With.A.Chance.Of.Meatballs.PROPER.H264&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5191311/Cloudy.With.A.Chance.Of.Meatballs.PROPER.H264&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5190694/The.Bad.Lieutenant.Port.of.Call.New.Orleans.LIMITED.H264&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5190694/The.Bad.Lieutenant.Port.of.Call.New.Orleans.LIMITED.H264&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEp.
