Prior to its announcement on July 22, 2005, Windows Vista was known by its codename &quot;Longhorn.&quot;[3] Development was completed on November 8, 2006; over the following three months it was released in stages to computer hardware and software manufacturers, business customers, and retail channels. On January 30, 2007, it was released worldwide,[4] and was made available for purchase and download from Microsoft's website.[5] The release of Windows Vista came more than five years after the introduction of its predecessor, Windows XP, the longest time span between successive releases of Microsoft Windows desktop operating systems. It was succeeded by Windows 7 which was released to manufacturing on July 22, 2009, and for the general public on October 22, 2009.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb96c35e7ab60535e0ef03de6bd6c3d44d4df071","amp;dn":"Windows+Vista+Beta+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb96c35e7ab60535e0ef03de6bd6c3d44d4df071","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,150,195,94,122,182,5,53,224,239,3,222,107,214,195,212,77,77,240,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
