(Not sure about other host forcing methods)\n\nPATCHING AND CR@CKING\n\n1. Patch modern warfare 2 to 1.0.180.  .NCF files can be ignored.\n2. Drag iw4mp.exe (from &quot;SkyLine console hack + sv_cheats bypass&quot; folder) over reCEG-xXX.exe (64bit users use reCEG-x64.exe and 32bit use x86) and it will run by itself. Old exe will become iw4mp.bak and new exe will be created.\n3. Copy and replace this new iw4mp.exe to your codmw2 folder. You now have your console enabled with sv_cheats enabled.\n4. Run codmw2 through steam. Using zero gear method or other similar method.\n\n\nFORCE HOSTING\n\nHere's a tutorial for getting your very own custom game up and running:\n1) badhost_endGameIfISuck 0\n2) iwnet_searching 0\n3) Join a lobby like TDM, it won't search for other players because you disabled it. Now do: map mp_rust/airport etc.\n4) While it's loading quickly do iwnet_searching 1 and you will be the host. You can change as you please, like g_gametype DM/DOM/WAR etc\n\n\nSee consolecommands.txt for comprehensive command list.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4966b7d48f46b86999a3de6a2ffc83b27288152f","amp;dn":"Call+of+Duty+Modern+Warfare+2+%7E+Multiplayer+Online+v1.0.180","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4966b7d48f46b86999a3de6a2ffc83b27288152f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,102,183,212,143,70,184,105,153,163,222,106,47,252,131,178,114,136,21,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
