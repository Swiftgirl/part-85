According to acoustic ecologist Gordon Hempton, there are only seven or eight naturally quiet placesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â°ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â°defined as where the sounds of nature are unbroken for intervals of at least 15 minutes during daylight hoursÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â°ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â°left in the United States.

Murray Schafer and his colleagues at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia as an attempt to define the relationship between humans and their environment, as mediated through sound. With a focus that spans both science and art, the continuum of acoustic ecology often attracts individuals who are part researcher, part composer, and part adventure\n\n\njust copy this url to listen to it,along with a text description and slideshow for a more complete experience:    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://seedmagazine.com/slideshow/ear_to_the_ground/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://seedmagazine.com/slideshow/ear_to_the_ground/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e812c3a940e8db2a8c009e6919588fe8ce19e0d4","amp;dn":"ZEN+++ear+to+the+ground+acoustic+ecology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e812c3a940e8db2a8c009e6919588fe8ce19e0d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,18,195,169,64,232,219,42,140,0,158,105,25,88,143,232,206,25,224,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
