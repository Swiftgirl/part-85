You can love in ways you can only yet hope and imagine; you can work magic and change your reality in ways that only belonging can bring.&quot; (Lazaris)\n\nOur lives have become enriched; our love is more radiant; and our spirituality is exuberant with vitality.\n\nWe can lift to new levels of living and loving; we can reach new dimensions of magic and miracles. And yet we wonder: Are we wrong or unappreciative to want or to expect more? During this stunning intensive we found more: We found the miracle of belonging. After exploring the Bounty and the Power of Belonging, Lazaris guides us through the Seven Challenges to Belonging \nand through our Personal Dark Wood. \n\nThen we find our way to Encounter the Ancients. In this magical and mystical encounter we receive gifts . . . Seven Gifts of Belonging . . . and then the magic happens: The miracle of belonging can unfold.\n\nThese excerpts are not the whole of this incredible excursion, but with these excerpts we can remember and reunite. With these excerpts we can begin a journey of extraordinary value. \n\nLazaris recorded a new meditation, The Miracle of Belonging, specifically for these excerpts and for those who are listening (part 3 in the files shared).\n\nThe length of these excerpts is approximately 7 1/2 hours. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://shop.lazaris.com/The_Miracle_of_Belonging_Gift_P635C50.cfm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://shop.lazaris.com/The_Miracle_of_Belonging_Gift_P635C50.cfm&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1686bcd197d016328fc9e8a991ab39c0be45b367","amp;dn":"Lazaris+-+The+Miracle+of+Belonging%3A+Gift+of+the+Ancients","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1686bcd197d016328fc9e8a991ab39c0be45b367","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,134,188,209,151,208,22,50,143,201,232,169,145,171,57,192,190,69,179,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
