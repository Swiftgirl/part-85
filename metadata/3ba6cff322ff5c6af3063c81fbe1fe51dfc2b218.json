An epic space adventure which sees you getting thrown in the galaxy's toughest prison, dressing up in women's clothes, and being interrogated by rubber clad space vixens - but not in that order. The game is a science fiction comedy, with a similar style of British humor to that of Adventure SoftÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s previous games, the Simon the Sorcerer series. The Feeble Files was the sixth game to use Adventure Soft's AGOS Engine. \n\nThis release contains the full &amp; uncut 4-CD version, the game manual, a walkthrough, and a utility from ScummVM to reduce the size of some of the game files on the hard-drive. Look for these shortcuts in the game's startmenu.\n\nRequires ScummVM to play.
