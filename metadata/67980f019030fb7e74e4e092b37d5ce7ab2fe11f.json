The British boom years of \n       the 90s introduced characters like Lara Croft to a world beyond \n       video games and players were propelled into the internet age.\n       \n       Woolley's investigation leads to the present day, where he finds \n       our morality tested in the world of Grand Theft Auto and our \n       identity becoming transported to the digital domain with virtual \n       realms like Runescape and World of Warcraft.\n\n\n                             Big up all scene massive!\n\n\n    \n                                       \n                GROUP  INFORMATION          \n         9 Years of the Force and still    \n                      going strong                  \n     \n\n           What we are looking for:\n\n           * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n           * 100mbit or gigabit archive sites for TV/XVID/ETC\n           * 1080p or 720p rippers pre retail or classics\n           * Fios cappers in u.s\n           * U.K or Pre Retail Dvdrippers\n           * Internal 100mbit 1tb+ dump sites for Exlusive group usage\n           * If you think you can help contact us on irc\n           * or email us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;62240d100107220a17110a4c030b&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67980f019030fb7e74e4e092b37d5ce7ab2fe11f","amp;dn":"Games.Britannia.S01E03.WS.PDTV.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67980f019030fb7e74e4e092b37d5ce7ab2fe11f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,152,15,1,144,48,251,126,116,228,224,146,179,125,92,231,171,47,225,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
