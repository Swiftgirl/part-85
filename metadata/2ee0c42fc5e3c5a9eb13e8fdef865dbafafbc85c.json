In India he witnesses a total solar eclipse - when the link to the light and heat that sustains us is cut off for a few precious minutes.\n\nBut heat and light are not the only power of the sun over the solar system. In Norway, Brian watches the battle between the sun's wind and earth, as the night sky glows with the northern lights.\n\nBeyond earth, the solar wind continues, creating dazzling aurora on other planets. Brian makes contact with Voyager, a probe that has been travelling since its launch 30 years ago. Now 14 billion kilometres away, Voyager has just detected the solar wind is beginning to peter out. But even here we haven't reached the end of the sun's rule.\n\nBrian explains how its greatest power, gravity, reaches out for hundreds of billions of kilometres, where the lightest gravitational touch encircles our solar system in a mysterious cloud of comets.\n\nBroadcast on:\n\n    BBC Two, 9:00pm Sunday 7th March 2010","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ee0c42fc5e3c5a9eb13e8fdef865dbafafbc85c","amp;dn":"BBC+Wonders+of+the+Solar+System+-+S01E01+XviD.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ee0c42fc5e3c5a9eb13e8fdef865dbafafbc85c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,224,196,47,197,227,197,169,235,19,232,253,239,134,93,186,250,251,200,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
