At times like that you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want to hear those traditional upbeat Christmas songs you find on every Christmas compilation and radio station, you want something a little different, not moody or dark per se, but different, dealing with issues other than &quot;all you want for Christmas&quot; or &quot;joy to the world&quot;. This album, compiling over 40 years of alternative artist and songs in an array of styles ranging from jazz to pop, from gospel to reggae, and from folk to blues, offers you such a selection of songs.\n\n\nChristmas Must Be Tonight:\n\n01 - John Coltrane ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Greensleeves\n02 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Tom Waits - Christmas Card From A Hooker In Minneapolis\n03 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Jackson Browne - The Rebel Jesus\n04 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ A.J.
