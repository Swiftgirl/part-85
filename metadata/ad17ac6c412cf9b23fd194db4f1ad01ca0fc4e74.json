They draw influence from various sub-genres of punk rock, including hardcore punk, skate punk and melodic hardcore, utilize sardonic lyrical content and visual aesthetics via lead singer Ken Chinn (Mr. Chi Pig), and initially built their sound around dual guitar work by twin brothers Marc &quot;Muc&quot; and Brent &quot;Bunnt&quot; Belke before being reduced to a single guitar group in 1998.\n\nSince their genesis, SNFU has released seven full-length studio albums, two live records, and an EP. The band has an unusual quirk of releasing albums with seven words in the title. \n\n\n\n\n\nSomething Green and Leafy This Way Comes 1993\n\n\nSomething Green and Leafy This Way Comes is an album by Edmonton punk rock band SNFU. The album was released in 1993.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;All Those Opposed&quot;\n2.\t&quot;Reality Is a Ride on the Bus&quot;\n3.\t&quot;Joni Mitchell Tapes&quot;\n4.\t&quot;A Bomb&quot;\n5.\t&quot;Tin Fish&quot;\n6.\t&quot;Painful Reminder&quot;\n7.\t&quot;Costume Trunk&quot;\n8.\t&quot;Gladly In Gloom&quot;\n9.\t&quot;This Is a Goodbye&quot;\n10.\t&quot;Strangely Strange&quot;\n11.\t&quot;X-Creep&quot;\n12.\t&quot;Trudging&quot;\n13.\t&quot;The Great Mind Eraser&quot;\n14.\t&quot;Limping Away&quot;\n15.\t&quot;Seven Minutes Closer to Death&quot;\n16.\t&quot;The Watering Hole&quot;\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad17ac6c412cf9b23fd194db4f1ad01ca0fc4e74","amp;dn":"SNFU+-+Something+Green+%26+Leafy+This+Way+Comes+%5BFLAC%5D+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad17ac6c412cf9b23fd194db4f1ad01ca0fc4e74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,23,172,108,65,44,249,178,63,209,148,219,79,26,208,28,160,252,78,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
