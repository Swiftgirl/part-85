Han vandrade 8252 kilometer i 947 dagar genom den kanadensiska vildmarken med endast sina hundar som sÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤llskap. Samtidigt filmade han sina upptÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥g. PÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ vintern krÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶p temperaturen ner till minus 60 grader, utanfÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶r tÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ltet strÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶k vargar omkring och Lars Monsen tvingades fÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rsvara sig mot bjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rnar. \n\nKategori: DokumentÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤r\nOriginaltitel: Canada From Coast To Coast\n\nAudio: Norweigan and English\n\nSubtitles: English and swedish (no english subtitle when they speak english though).\n\n\n\n\nHe walked 8252 km and 947 days through some of earthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most desolate territories, accompanied with bears and wolfs. For Lars Monsen this was the perfect challenge.\n\n \n\nIn the Canadian wilderness you are completely on your own, hundreds of km from the nearest village, packs of wolves traveling right by the camp and Monsen having to defend him self against Bears. In the winter the thermometer can get close to minus 60 degrees Celsius and further the wind will intensify the coldness. It is highly dangerous to go out side if you are not properly trained, have excellent equipment and have a great respect for Mother Nature. It is in this terrain Lars Monsen and his huskies are going to spend the next couple of years. \n\nOn foot, on a dog sledge, on skies and in a canoe is how Lars Monsen will travel from North east-Alaska to the Labrador-coast. This is close to an impossible task but then again is Lars Monsens motto: Everything is possible. \n\n Lars Monsen is one of NorwayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most famous adventurers. He has spent more then 3400 days in the wilderness and over half of them during winter season. Many of his expeditions take place north for the polar circle in wild, tough and inhospitable terrain.
