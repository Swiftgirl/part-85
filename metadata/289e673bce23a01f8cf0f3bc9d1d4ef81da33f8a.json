Beethoven with XVIIIth century instruments? Doesn't it act of a retrograde joke, using of historical, even passeist instruments as much inappropriate for the composer the future? What has the comoser to get in this systematic return to the sonority known as &quot;of the time&quot;?\n\nLooking at it more closely, &quot;to reconcile&quot; Beethoven with XVIIIth is not in itself incorrect: all his baggage owes to Haydn and to Mozart, the Masters of the Viennese classicism of which the Master of Bonn is a natural disciple. His Symphonies nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â°1 and 2 have this measured classicism which besides, made that they were put on side, corresponding, in the taste of the admirors, very little with the romantic and passional energy of the other opus... BrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ggen explained himself on his pupose while proposing in each beethovenian symphony, the notion of the sound. Beethoven thinks the music by family of instruments. Each grain, each color of instrument constitutes its vocabulary. And the composer arrange them according to his design. The importance of the instrument is all the more striking in the first two symphonies which are in narrow relationship with those of Haydn.\n\nWith Beethoven, the singularity of the instrument acquires its letters of nobility: the timpanis become soloists, and the woods simply do not restrict themselves to double the strings. Moreover, a witness of the second symphony was astonished by &quot;the immoderate use of the winds&quot;. Each sound is associated with a specific color of feeling. The force of the orchestration imposes Beethoven as the founder of the romantic orchestra. The musician works out a gifted totality from now on with his own personality. It is an abstract but expressive action, fertilizing, and plentiful thanks to the quality of his pallet of sounds. The mark of BrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ggen in &quot;daring&quot; to play Beethoven with his XVIIIth century Orchestra, appears a winner in that it reveals the expressive richness of texture, the combinations and instrumental meltings. BrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ggen lights one of the key components of beethovenian esthetics. With all the more of relevance that his approach articulates the rhythmic tenure, the dynamics and the &quot;dramaturgy&quot; of the scores. This complete set recorded in December 2006 in Paris (ThÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢tre des Champs-ElysÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©es) brings an original lighting on the will of one of the symphonist geniuses in history.
