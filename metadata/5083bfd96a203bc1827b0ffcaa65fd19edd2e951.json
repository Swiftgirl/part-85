Despite great critical acclaim 'The Ones We Never New' didn't achieve commercial success and she was soon dropped from the label. \n\nFollowing a car crash, which left her badly injured in 2006, she rebuilt her career and released 'Here With Me' last year.\n\nHolly is in the middle of a European tour and joins Bob live in the studio.\n\n\n\nTracklist: \n\nCarlene Carter - Why Be Blue\nStronger, Yep Roc \n\nLevon Stuff - You Gotta Watch\nElectric Dirt, Vanguard\n \nNanci Griffith - This Old Town\nOther Voices / Other Rooms, MCA \n\nSteve Martin - Daddy Played The Banjo\nThe Crow, ROUNDER \n\nCarolina Chocolate Drops Cornbread and Butter Beans\nGenuine Negro Jig, Nonesuch Pro\n \nDiana Jones Love O Love\nSparrow, Proper \n\nRay Wylie ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Loose\nHubbard, A Enlightenment B Endarkenment \n\nHolly Williams - Mama\n\nHolly Williams - Without Jesus Here With Me\n\nHolly Williams - Keep The Change\nHere With Me, Wrasse Records \n\nHank Williams - I'll Fly Away\nThe Unreleased Recordings, Time Life \n\n\n\n\nI hope you enjoy the show\n\nPlease seed! \n\nThanks \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5083bfd96a203bc1827b0ffcaa65fd19edd2e951","amp;dn":"BBC+Radio+2+-+Bob+Harris+Country+-+11+Feb+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5083bfd96a203bc1827b0ffcaa65fd19edd2e951","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,131,191,217,106,32,59,193,130,123,15,252,170,101,253,25,237,210,233,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
