It seems Boleslaus has gotten a little heavy-handed with issuing death penalties, and even worse, he's in love with a woman other than his queen, whom he married purely for politics. The bishop threatens excommunication; the king threatens to behead him. Something's gotta give!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bda46f5ea7c58c446fb39ecec8bad4b07739d32","amp;dn":"Boleslaw+Smialy+%2F+King+Boleslaus+the+Bold","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bda46f5ea7c58c446fb39ecec8bad4b07739d32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,218,70,245,234,124,88,196,70,251,57,236,236,139,173,75,7,115,157,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
