I took downloaded it from mukatat3, whom I don't know. Basically I am a student that would like to see a greater spread of educational programs like this one. I happen to study bones, and this is an elegant program. I am unsure whether this is the full version or not. I downloaded the trail, and the size differs (heavier on the trail version). This seems to be fully functional, and it is clean (Tested in linux virtualbox windows 7 &amp; eset smart security 4). If you discover this is not the full version, leave a note. If you know where the full version might be for this, bonelab II or anatomylab II, leave a note please. \n\nBoneLab is a teaching, learning and presentation tool for the anatomy of the human skeleton. BoneLab is suitable for secondary level school education, pre-university education and patient education. It is used by many High School teachers in various countries.
