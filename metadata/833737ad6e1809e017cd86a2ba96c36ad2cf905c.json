Ouch.  If you havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t seen it, let me just say that encounter had to be at least as awkward as the alleged encounters between Massa and his staffers. I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t think IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve ever seen a worse train wreck on television that didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t involve an actual train wreck. I was hoping that Glenn Beck was going to throw a frog in boiling water just to break the tension. As riveting television goes, this really had me missing the curling competitions. Actually it was a lot like the curling matchesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½nothing was happening, but you couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t stop watching it. Only one person could have enjoyed watching thisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Geraldo Rivera. The opening of Al CaponeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vaults is no longer the biggest bust in the history of television. In a way it was all rather fitting. A guy who seems to be going crazy dropped in on a guy who went there a long time ago. It was almost like watching a welcoming ceremony to Crazy WorldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½one that didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t go too smoothly. Gee, I hope Eric Massa passed the initiation and gets in.\n\nThe Beck interview came shortly after news broke that Massa was being investigated for groping several male staff members.  Unfortunately, the Congressman kept on groping during the interview. His response to the groping allegations? He said ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNot only did I grope him, I tickled him until he couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t breathe.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ OK. There are ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“non-denial denials,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ but thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the most NON non-denial IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve ever heard. It was more like an affirmation denial. Heck, it was almost a celebration denial. (But it must have been a denial, because hours later on Larry King, Massa said itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not true that he groped anyone.  Also, when asked straight upÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ahemÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½by Larry King if he was gay, Massa said ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not going to answer that. In the year 2010? Why donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t you ask my wife, ask my friends. Ask the 10,000 sailors I served with in the Navy.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ HereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a quick piece of adviceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½if you want to stay in the closet, when somebody asks if you are gay, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s probably not good to use the phrase ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ10,000 sailorsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ anywhere in the answer.)\n\nThe bottom line on the Beck interview is that Beck wanted Massa to give him evidence of some elaborate White House plot to set-up Eric Massa. The interview hardly could have come out worse for Beck if the whole thing had been an elaborate White House plot to set up Glenn Beck.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:833737ad6e1809e017cd86a2ba96c36ad2cf905c","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+March+10+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"833737ad6e1809e017cd86a2ba96c36ad2cf905c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,55,55,173,110,24,9,224,23,205,134,162,186,150,195,106,210,207,144,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
