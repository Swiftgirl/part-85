It entered the UK Albums Chart at number one, where it remained on the position for three weeks, selling 260,000 copies in the same time frame. &quot;Tragedy&quot;, &quot;Love's Got A Hold On My Heart&quot;, &quot;After the Love Has Gone&quot;, &quot;Say You'll Be Mine&quot;, &quot;Deeper Shade of Blue&quot; and &quot;When I Said Goodbye&quot; were released as singles. Many of the songs also appeared on the track list of the US version of their debut album Step One. Like the group's debut album, Steptacular also contains a cover, originally released by female pop group Bananarama, entitled &quot;Movin' On&quot;. Unlike in Step One, their version of Bee Gees' &quot;Tragedy&quot; was recorded in this album as a main track and not a bonus track. It entered the UK Albums Chart at number one, selling 84,000 units in its first weekÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½only 1,000 copies ahead of Westlife's debut album, Westlife, beating the phenomenal Irish boyband. Early UK copies of the album featured a holographic silver &quot;STEPS&quot; logo on front. It was also released in cardboard and tin boxed sets, internationally.\n\nAmazon.co.uk Review By Ian Fortnam - Following their initial inception in 1997, the five extraordinarily exuberant members of Steps rapidly gravitated to the very peak of the pop pile with an irresistible coalition of infectious melodies, lashings of personality and charismatic sparkle. Following hot on the heels of Step One, this second collection further consolidated the band's position as a seductively up beat Abba for the 1990s. Kicking off with the triple barrelled fusillade of &quot;Tragedy&quot;, &quot;After The Love Has Gone&quot; and &quot;Love's Got A Hold On My Heart&quot;, Steptacular proceeds into hitherto uncharted areas of down-tempo maturity with the contemplative, heart-string stroking of &quot;You're Everything That Matters To Me&quot; and melancholic introspection of &quot;Since You Took Your Love Away&quot;. Yet Steptacular still boasts a rich surfeit of Lisa, Faye, Lee, H and Claire's singular sonic bounce--witness the lush simplicity of 'Say You'll Be Mine', yet another sure step on the stairway to pop heaven. \n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Tragedy\n[02] After The Love Has Gone\n[03] Love's Got A Hold On My Heart\n[04] Say You'll Be Mine\n[05] I Think It's Love\n[06] Make It Easy On Me\n[07] Deeper Shade Of Blue\n[08] Movin' On\n[09] Never Say Never Again\n[10] When I Said Goodbye\n[11] I Surrender\n[12] Since You Took Your Love Away\n[13] My Best Friend's Girl\n[14] You're Everything That Matters To Me\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t&gt; 00h:55m:38s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 140mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I- Tunes v7.70.43 Mp3 Format\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi &amp; 200 dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Pop\nRelease Date\t&gt; 25 October 1999\nRecord Company\t&gt; Jive Zomba Records\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; \n\n&gt; http://www.pop-music.com/steps\n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steps_%28group%29 \n&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/s/steps.html \n&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/steps\n&gt;[Deeper Shade Of Blue]\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bcb91276d4679c3925f74cd35e8426c92a3ece0","amp;dn":"%5B1999%5D+Steptacular+-+Steps+140mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bcb91276d4679c3925f74cd35e8426c92a3ece0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,203,145,39,109,70,121,195,146,95,116,205,53,232,66,108,146,163,236,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
