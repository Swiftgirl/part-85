What Really Happened is proud to be one of the oldest political blogs on the net.\nRivero runs the WhatReallyHappened radio show on GCN six days a week, and makes good use of his sharp wit to help his blog visitors and radio listeners not only to read/hear the news but to understand what IS really happening. \n\n===============================================================\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d8619f29c9aa360cae0a0f20cd17d3efd34b913","amp;dn":"What+Really+Happened+-+Feb+18+TH+%5Bsebaygo1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d8619f29c9aa360cae0a0f20cd17d3efd34b913","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,134,25,242,156,154,163,96,202,224,160,242,12,209,125,62,253,52,185,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
