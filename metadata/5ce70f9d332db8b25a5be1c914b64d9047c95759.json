Released on November 4, 1977, the album incorporates surf rock and other influences. It includes some of the Ramones' best-known songs, including &quot;Sheena Is a Punk Rocker&quot; and &quot;Teenage Lobotomy&quot;. In 2003, the album was ranked number 105 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nThe Ramones (/rÃƒâ€°Ã¢â€žÂ¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã‚Â¡monz/) were an American rock band often regarded as the first punk rock group. The group was formed in Forest Hills, Queens, New York in 1974. All of the band members adopted pseudonyms ending with the surname &quot;Ramone&quot;, though none of them were actually related. They performed 2,263 concerts, touring virtually nonstop for 22 years. In 1996, after a tour with the Lollapalooza music festival, the band played a farewell show and disbanded. By a little more than eight years after the breakup, the band's three founding membersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½lead singer Joey Ramone, guitarist Johnny Ramone, and bassist Dee Dee RamoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½had all died.\n\nThe Ramones were a major influence on the punk rock movement both in the United States and the United Kingdom, though they achieved only minor commercial success. Their only record with enough U.S. sales to be certified gold was the compilation album Ramones Mania. Recognition of the band's importance built over the years, and they are now cited in many assessments of all-time great rock music, such as the Rolling Stone lists of the 50 Greatest Artists of All Time and VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. In 2002, the Ramones were ranked the second-greatest band of all time by Spin magazine, trailing only The Beatles. On March 18, 2002, the RamonesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½including the three founders and drummers Marky and Tommy RamoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ce70f9d332db8b25a5be1c914b64d9047c95759","amp;dn":"The+Ramones+-+Rockaway+Beach++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ce70f9d332db8b25a5be1c914b64d9047c95759","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,231,15,157,51,45,184,178,90,91,225,201,20,182,77,144,71,201,87,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
