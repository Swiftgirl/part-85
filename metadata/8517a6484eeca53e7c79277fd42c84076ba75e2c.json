Quite sad, because its a really good Reggae/Dancehall/Hip-Hop Album with a lot of famous Feature-guests.\n\nJoni Rewind is the alter ego of DJ Dynamite of the popular german Rap-Group &quot;Dynamite Deluxe&quot;, who brought out his first (and until today) only Solo-Album  in 2002. My personal favourites on there are &quot;Madness (Joni's Theme)&quot; and a Remake of &quot;Uptown Top Rankin'&quot; with an at that time unknown Est'elle.\n\n\n1. Intro (Pull Up) (feat. Junior Reid)\n2. Inna Dance (feat. Seanie T, Karl Hinds, DJ Mixwell)\n3. Can't Fuck With Them (feat. Diamond D, Lord Finesse, Jahai)\n4. Madness (Joni's Theme) (feat. Blak Twang)\n5.
