It filters out unwanted        \n        SMS by senders and contents you specify. It notifies you of new         \n        incoming SMS using customized alert tones for different phone           \n        numbers / contacts of your choice. It also can send encrypted           \n        SMS to people in a list of you own. It lets you create template         \n        SMS and assign hotkeys to those templates so that you send a            \n        predefined SMS by simply pressing some keys on your phone               \n        screen. It groups all your messages into conversation thread            \n        based on senders and receivers so that you can view messages in         \n        context. It also reminds you of unread SMS periodically. It             \n        generates monthly SMS usage report for you. It can automatically        \n        reply to incoming SMS with your specified message according to          \n        your specified time schedules.

Do not use the built-in Symbian browser,\n       but a program like X-Plore (free version works too).\n\n       Step 2: Send HelloCarbide and installserver.exe to your phone\n       (S60v3 Device). Do not open them yet.\n\n       Step 3: Close any programs that may be running on your phone,\n       except the file browser.\n\n       Step 4: Install and Run HelloCarbide.sis. Now go to options,\n       then to menu1. Keep Pressing the selection key untill it crashes.\n       This is normal. You will have access to the system/private folders.\n\n       Step 5: Use the file manager to copy installserver.exe into the\n       c:sysbin folder of your phone. This allows you to install\n       unsigned apps.\n\n       Now Simply send the Unsigned Releases from ErESPDA to your phone\n       and install without any complications. ^_^\n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n                                                                      \n                     - -- --- ----  Group  Info  ---- --- -- -              \n                                                                             \n                                We are looking for                        \n                                                                         \n                 - Crackers for all Operating Systems                 \n                                                                      \n                 - Quality suppliers                                 \n                                                                      \n                 - Good 100Mbit+ EU &amp; Asia Sites to affil with       \n                                                                        \n                 - Anything else you think we might like              \n                                                                       \n                       e r e s p d a  a t  g m a i l . c o m            \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n    \n     - \u0015  i i -b  -p   K - R  M -t H  -w  R L D -o F -1 3 3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b12863a0a3da96f532b827156d75ad04e78e67c","amp;dn":"Fingertip.Access.Ultimate.SMS.v.3.1.1.S60v3.SymbianOS9.1.Unsigne","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b12863a0a3da96f532b827156d75ad04e78e67c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,18,134,58,10,61,169,111,83,43,130,113,86,215,90,208,78,120,230,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
