And the savior John Conner is doing everything he can to make sure man survives. He thinks he's found a way to ensure that, and he also learns that the machines have targeted the man who's suppose to father him, Kyle Reese, so he tries to find him. One of Conner's soldiers meets a man named Marcus Wright who has no knowledge of Judgment Day. When they reach the base they discover Wright is part machine and suspect that he was sent by Skynet but Wright claims that's not true.\n\nIn 2003, in the Longview State Correctional Facility, the criminal Marcus Wright that is in the death row is convinced by the cancerous Dr. Serena Kogan to donate his body to her research and he accepts. In 2018, after an unsuccessful attack to a Skynet facility, only John Connor survives, but he discovers that Skynet is developing the powerful new model T-800. Out of the blue, Marcus appears naked and with amnesia in the location. Marcus befriends the teenager Kyle Reese and the girl Star that help him to survive to lethal machines and they travel together in a Jeep. Meanwhile the resistance discovers a signal that might turn-off the machines and John offers to test it. When Kyle is captured by a machine and brought to the Skynet headquarter, Marcus decides to help the youngster and heads to Skynet; on the way, he saves Blair Williams that suggests him to meet John Connor first. But Marcus steps on a mine and is submitted to a surgery, when a secret about his origins is disclosed.\n\nSet in post-apocalyptic 2018, John Connor is the man fated to lead the human resistance against Skynet and its army of Terminators. But the future Connor was raised to believe in is altered in part by the appearance of Marcus Wright, a stranger whose last memory is of being on death row. Connor must decide whether Marcus has been sent from the future, or rescued from the past. As Skynet prepares its final onslaught, Connor and Marcus both embark on an odyssey that takes them into the heart of SkynetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s operations, where they uncover the terrible secret behind the possible annihilation of mankind.\n\nCast: Christian Bale, Sam Worthington, Moon Bloodgood, Anton Yelchin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n                                              000000\n                                            0000000000\n                                          000000   00000\n                   000000               000000      000000\n                 0000000000            00000          00000\n               000000   00000         00000            00000\n              00000       00000      00000              00000\n             00000                   0000                0000\n00000000   00000                     0000                0000\n00000000   00000                     0000                0000\n00000000   00000                     0000                0000\n00000000    00000                    0000                0000\n              00000                  0000                0000\n               0000000               0000                0000\n                 000000000           0000                0000\n00000000              000000         0000                0000\n00000000                00000        0000                0000\n00000000                 00000       0000                0000\n00000000                  00000      0000                0000\n00000000                  00000      0000                0000\n00000000                  00000      0000                0000\n00000000                 00000       0000                0000\n00000000   00000        00000        0000                0000\n00000000    00000      00000         0000                0000\n00000000      00000   00000          0000                0000\n00000000        000000000            00000              00000\n00000000          00000               000000          000000\n00000000                               000000        000000\n                                         000000    000000\n                                           000000000000\n                                             00000000","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2fed9ad4f00fd6e4fb5f62834bc6dde967abfd2","amp;dn":"Terminator.Salvation%5B2009%5D++iSO+Man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2fed9ad4f00fd6e4fb5f62834bc6dde967abfd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,254,217,173,79,0,253,110,79,181,246,40,52,188,109,222,150,122,191,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
