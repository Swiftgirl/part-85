At the end of each show the audience vote for which idea put forward that week should win the coveted 'Genius Trophy'.\n\n\n\nwww.comedy.org.uk Review: \nA clever idea for a show. It is rare that a comedy show involves so much participation from members of the public. In a way Genius is a bit like a talent show, but one for people who actually have talent and intelligence!\n\nThe series is certainly successful in the eyes of the BBC. They have now ordered a full series of the television version, although the radio version of Genius is continuing.\n\nIt should be noted that Genius is not always looked upon favourably by listeners. The last idea of the third series was to improve the Genius voting system. It was indeed changed in the following episode.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/radio/genius/episodes/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/radio/genius/episodes/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nGenius - S01 - E01 - Paul Daniels \nGenius - S01 - E02 - Richard Madeley \nGenius - S01 - E03 - John Fortune \nGenius - S01 - E04 - Neil Innes \nGenius - S01 - E05 - Stewart Lee \n\nGenius - S02 - E01 - Johnny Vegas \nGenius - S02 - E02 - Carol Vorderman \nGenius - S02 - E03 - Brian Sewell \nGenius - S02 - E04 - Chris Addison \nGenius - S02 - E05 - Sid Waddell \nGenius - S02 - E06 - Armando Iannucc \n\nGenius - S03 - E01 - Rob Newman \nGenius - S03 - E02 - Germaine Greer \nGenius - S03 - E03 - Simon Munnery \nGenius - S03 - E04 - Gyles Brandreth \nGenius - S03 - E05 - Matthew Wright \nGenius - S03 - E06 - Charlie Brooker \nGenius - S03 - ESP - Lee Mack \n\n\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration Approx : 28mn 54s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits\n\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f47d640aed8257b1a6442cfa5ed662b44c4c715","amp;dn":"Genius+-+Series+01+to+03+-+Audio+Comedy+-+Mp3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f47d640aed8257b1a6442cfa5ed662b44c4c715","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,71,214,64,174,216,37,123,26,100,66,207,165,237,102,43,68,196,199,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
