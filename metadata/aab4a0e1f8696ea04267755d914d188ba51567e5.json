These astonishingly choreographed, brilliantly acted, and socially progressive\n\n'teleplays' constituted an artistic high for the medium, bringing Broadway-quality drama to all of\n\nAmerica. The award-winning programs included in this box set -- originally curated for PBS in the\n\nearly 1980s as the series The Golden Age of Television, featuring recollections from key cast and\n\ncrew members -- were conceived by such up-and-comers as Rod Serling and John Frankenheimer and star\n\nthe likes of Paul Newman, Mickey Rooney, Rod Steiger, Julie Harris, and Piper Laurie.\n\n\n\n================\n\nDISC TWO\n\n================\n\n\n\n&quot;A WIND FROM THE SOUTH&quot; (51 min.)
