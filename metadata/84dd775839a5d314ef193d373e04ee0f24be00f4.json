Available for both Microsoft Windows 3.1 and the Apple Macintosh, it contained versions of Tempest, Battlezone, Asteroids, Centipede, and Missile Command. Although the games were very similar to the original games in both appearance and gameplay, they were newly-written versions, not ports of the original arcade game code. Each game allowed certain customizations not available in the original arcade game, i.e. the number of lives and bonus levels. \n\nThis release also includes a launcher for the &quot;Arcade&quot; collection.\n______________________________________________________________________\n\n'Built on LT technology' ...
