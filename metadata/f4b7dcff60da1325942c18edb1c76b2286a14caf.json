It is the first album by the second lineup of the band, featuring Ian Peres (bass, keyboards), Aidan Nemeth (guitar) and Dave Atkins (drums), formed in 2009 after original members Chris Ross and Myles Heskett left in August 2008. Upon its release, Cosmic Egg charted at number three on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart, the same position as the band's first album.\n\nThe album was recorded between April and May 2009 at Sound City Studios and Sunset Sound Studios in Los Angeles, California. The title of the album comes from a position in yoga described by vocalist and guitarist Andrew Stockdale as &quot;like the fetal pose.&quot; The album's release is being promoted by a series of tours beginning in September. The first song released from the album was the promotional digital download single &quot;Back Round&quot; on 2 June 2009; &quot;New Moon Rising&quot; was the first full single release from Cosmic Egg, on 25 August 2009.\n\nWolfmother are an Australian hard rock band that formed in Erskineville, Sydney in 2000. Originally a trio comprising vocalist and guitarist Andrew Stockdale, bassist and keyboardist Chris Ross and drummer Myles Heskett, the band released their debut self-titled album in October 2005, which reached number three on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart. The album was also a critical success, winning the 2005 J Award and 2006 ARIA Awards for Best Breakthrough Album and Best Rock Album. &quot;Woman&quot;, a single from the album, won the band their first Grammy Award, for Best Hard Rock Performance, in 2007.\n\nIn August 2008, co-founding members Ross and Heskett left the band due to &quot;irreconcilable personal and musical differences,&quot; after which Stockdale vowed to continue using the Wolfmother moniker with new members in the future. After a brief hiatus, Stockdale returned with a new four-piece band in January 2009 featuring bassist and keyboardist Ian Peres, rhythm guitarist Aidan Nemeth and drummer Dave Atkins. The new lineup's first album (entitled Cosmic Egg) was released on 23 October 2009.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4b7dcff60da1325942c18edb1c76b2286a14caf","amp;dn":"Wolfmother+-+New+Moon+Rising+++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4b7dcff60da1325942c18edb1c76b2286a14caf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,183,220,255,96,218,19,37,148,44,24,237,177,199,107,34,134,161,76,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
