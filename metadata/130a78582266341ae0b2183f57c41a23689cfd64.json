(And really, in  |\n|  the music business environment of the 2000s, in which the sales life of   |\n|  an album is much abbreviated from previous decades, why not?) His backup  |\n|  musicians may have been replaced since 2007 (and the drum chair has now   |\n|  passed to a third man, Richie Monica, with Marcus Ratzenboeck joining on  |\n|  electric violin), but Ferreira still positions Tantric squarely in the    |\n|  post-grunge tradition of peers like System of a Down, Linkin Park, and,   |\n|  especially, Nickelback, placing his sonorous, husky baritone over tracks  |\n|  that sometimes border on heavy metal, but usually retain a melodic hard   |\n|  rock flavor. He sneaks in some of his own piano playing, notably on the   |\n|  intro and outro to &quot;Coming Undone,&quot; and gives some rein to guitarist Joe  |\n|  Pessia, who does Eddie Van Halen-style shredding on &quot;Coming Undone&quot;;      |\n|  contributes attractive acoustic work on the power ballad &quot;The Past Is     |\n|  the Past&quot;; and enjoys his own showcase on the guitar interlude            |\n|  &quot;Intermezzo,&quot; when he isn't simply crunching big riffs. So, there are at  |\n|  least hints that Ferreira and his new bandmates have ambitions beyond     |\n|  their genre, but there are also some more potential entries in            |\n|  Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart here.                                   |\n|                                                                            |\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:130a78582266341ae0b2183f57c41a23689cfd64","amp;dn":"Tantric-Mind_Control-2009-RVP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"130a78582266341ae0b2183f57c41a23689cfd64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,10,120,88,34,102,52,26,224,178,24,63,87,196,26,35,104,156,253,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
