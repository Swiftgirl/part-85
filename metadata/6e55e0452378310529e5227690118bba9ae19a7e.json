That music lay untouched for years before its merits were reassessed for inclusion in the PaPERHOUsE project. Work began in 1989 after a confusing time in Switzerland took the life out of Click Click. The Department Of Polyrhythmic Experimentation (D.O.P.E.) began assembling the contents of the vaults in 1991 and the first recordings, a tape entitled Disintegration, came out in 1994 (Not Enough Memory.) Several more tapes were finished throughout the 90's before Click Click reformed in 97 to produce Shadowblack. Work resumed with PaPERHOUsE shortly thereafter and the CD On Acid Too was finally released in 2000. Sappho followed a year later.\n\nThe PaPERHOUsE project closed down in 2007 but most of the back catalogue is available in Free Download form at LastFM.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e55e0452378310529e5227690118bba9ae19a7e","amp;dn":"Paperhouse+-+On+Acid+Too","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e55e0452378310529e5227690118bba9ae19a7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,85,224,69,35,120,49,5,41,229,34,118,144,17,139,186,154,225,154,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
