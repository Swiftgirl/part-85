This show aired once or twice in the US, and many critics regard it as the least of Cleese's works, citing flat humor, low budget, and ethnic references which may be inappropriate by modern standards.  The last has probably received the greatest assault in dismissing this movie, yet the original Monty Python series had far more racially-charged material.  \n\n\nAll in all, even if this is not the best work that John Cleese ever did, it is still John Cleese. And that alone puts it head and shoulders above 99% of the rest of what passes for comedy these days.  So there.
