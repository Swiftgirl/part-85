Though professor Yagihara (played by silent film star Denjiro Okochi) is relieved of his teaching responsibilities, his young vivacious daughter, Yukie (Setsuko Hara), remains blithely unaware of the fractious state of Japanese society of the time. Yet she quickly understands when one of her father's students, Ryukichi Noge (Susumu Fujita) -- who Yukie has quietly fallen in love with -- is jailed for his writings. He is eventually freed and they move in together. Later, he is accused of being a spy and shot. Yukie decides to not only carry his ashes back to his rural hometown, but she resolves to live near his remains and work among the village's farmers.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Waga Seishun Ni Kuinashi.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.38 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 50mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 789 Kbps\n      Writing application : Nandub v1.0rc2\n      Writing library : Nandub build 1852/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Custom\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 50mn\n      Bit rate : 1 708 Kbps\n      Width : 608 pixels\n      Height : 464 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.252\n      Stream size : 1.32 GiB (95%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 50mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 68.0 Kbps\n      Minimum bit rate : 32.0 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 53.9 MiB (4%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 24 ms (0.58 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 259 ms\n      Writing library : LAME3.97b\n      Encoding settings : -m j -V 5 -q 3 -lowpass 16 --vbr-new -b 32\n\nIMDB: tt0039090\n\nJapanese audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nEclipse rip posted at KG by mteste","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cd87c1f8615be3399d74a20870d0bab7a6c7bb2","amp;dn":"Akira+Kurosawa+-+Waga+Seishun+Ni+Kuinashi+%5B1946%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cd87c1f8615be3399d74a20870d0bab7a6c7bb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,216,124,31,134,21,190,51,153,215,74,32,135,13,11,171,122,108,123,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
