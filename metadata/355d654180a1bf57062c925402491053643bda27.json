Played on two great instruments: Kirckman single-manual harpsichord (1764), Shudi double-manual harpsichord (1740).\nHuge thanks to Macropus for sharing this on melomaniacos. I'm assuming you don't mind me sharing this on demonoid. It's been a while since your last upload here. And since this is a must have, I though I'd share it.\n\nThis is the first complete recording of James NaresÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s eight brilliant harpsichord suites of 1747. Organist of the Chapel Royal, James Nares epitomizes the late English Baroque style; one which takes after the keyboard sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti and Thomas Arne.\n\n\n\nPLEASE SEED AFTER COMPLETION !! Enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:355d654180a1bf57062c925402491053643bda27","amp;dn":"James+Nares+-+Eight+Harpsichord+Setts+%28Julian+Perkins%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"355d654180a1bf57062c925402491053643bda27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,93,101,65,128,161,191,87,6,44,146,84,2,73,16,83,100,59,218,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
