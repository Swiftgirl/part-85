Os Mutantes examines the lives of Pedro, Ricardo and Andreia, three kids in their early teens who have rejected life in juvenile homes or with foster families to take their chances on their own. They drift into petty crime and are exploited by sexual predators; the two boys end up working in a pornographic film, while Andreia becomes pregnant. When Andreia turns to her mother for help, the mother turns her away, telling her she can barely support herself, let alone a new baby. Os Mutantes was filmed with a largely non-professional cast; director Teresa Villaverde had originally planned to make a documentary about homeless children, but when government authorities refused to cooperate, she used her research as the basis for this screenplay, giving many of the children she met in her travels roles in the film.\n\nLanguage: Portuguese\nSubtitles: English Hardsubbed\n\nThis film was nominated for four Golden Globes, Portugal which were:\n\nBest Film: Teresa Villaverde\nBest Director: Teresa Villaverde\nBest Actor: Alexandre Pinto\nBest Actress: Ana Moreira\n\nFrom the 1998 Cannes Un Certain Regard selection:\n\nFile Name ..........: Os.Mutantes.Teresa.Villaverde.1998.DVDRip.XviD.avi\nTotal Size (Bytes) .: 1.232.109.568 Bytes\nTotal Size (KB) ....: 1.203.232 KB\nTotal Size (MB) ....: 1.175,03 MB\nTotal Streams ......: 2 Stream(s)\nFile Size Correct ..: Yes\n\nVideo Size (Bytes) .: 1.124.499.352 Bytes\nVideo Size (KB) ....: 1.098.144 KB\nVideo Size (MB) ....: 1.072,41 MB\nVideo Length .......: 01:52:05\nVideo Codec Code ...: XVID\nVideo Codec Name ...: XviD MPEG-4 codec\nVideo Bitrate ......: 1337 KB/s\nResolution .........: 704 x 432\nAspect Ratio .......: 1.62:1\nTotal Frames .......: 168132 Frames\nFramerate ..........: 25 FPS\nColor Depth ........: 12 Bits\nQuality Factor .....: 0,175 B/px\nPacked Bitstream ...: No\n\nAudio Size (Bytes) .: 107.600.000 Bytes\nAudio Size (KB) ....: 105.078 KB\nAudio Size (MB) ....: 102,62 MB\nAudio Length .......: 01:52:04\nAudio Codec Code ...: 85 (0x0055)\nAudio Codec Name ...: MPEG-1 Layer 3 (MP3)\nAudio Bitrate ......: 128 KB/s (CBR)\nChannels ...........: 2 Ch\nSampling Rate ......: 48000 Hz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17576c52f6d03bc62f180de3e53faf8327e37336","amp;dn":"The+Mutants+%281998%29+-+Teresa+Villaverde+-+DVDRip+XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17576c52f6d03bc62f180de3e53faf8327e37336","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,87,108,82,246,208,59,198,47,24,13,227,229,63,175,131,39,227,115,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
