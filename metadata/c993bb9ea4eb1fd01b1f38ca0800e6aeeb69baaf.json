This includes being compatible with all demos, configuration files, and savegames that works with the original executables. Thus, it provides the same &quot;feel&quot; as DOS Doom (display and input should behave the same), and as far as possible, provides all the same features that are available using the DOS version.\n\t\nThe port's name is wordplay with the term vanilla Doom sometimes used by Doom fans (especially those regularly using modified source ports) to refer to unmodified Doom engine behavior or to the out-of-the-box executables. \n\t\nLike DOSBox and ScummVM, the port is based on SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) and will run on many different platforms, processor architectures, and operating systems. This includes Microsoft Windows (NT, 95/98, XP, Vista, 7), Linux, Mac OS X, and BSD.\n\nThis release will not create a shortcut ChocolateDoom because this particular emulator does not run by itself without specifying a .WAD first. \n\nComing soon: ppGames for Classic Doom!\n______________________________________________________________________\n\n'Built on LT technology' ...
