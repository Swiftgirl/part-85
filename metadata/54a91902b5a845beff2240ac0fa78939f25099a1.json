Animalympics\n               is a mad and marvelous cartoon comedy jam-packed \n               with a laugh menagerie of animal contestants.\n\n                 For fourteen days, the competition rages.\n               You'll meet international stars like Bruce\n               Kawakimoto, the duck expert in the esoteric\n               martial art of &quot;No Can Do&quot;; Kit Mambo, the\n               long-distance lioness matched up against\n               Europe's top goat marathon runner Rene Fromage;\n               Byonique Boar, the mechanically perfect ski-slope\n               wizard, and lovely Eurasian gymnast Tatyana\n               Tushenko, whose floor exercises may floor you.\n     \n\n                                                              \n                                                  \n                             \n                                      \n                            -+ Rip Notes +-                      \n                                                              \n\n                 From Steven Lisberger, who would later go on\n               to make TRON, we (again) bring you this largely\n               forgotten classic. To celebrate the 2010 Winter\n               Olympics, we're updating our VHS rip from 2006\n               with a sharp DVD rip, unavailable in any English-\n               speaking countries! It has a German title screen,\n               but features the original English soundtrack.\n               We had to do a little cleanup on the spliced in\n               German intro, which was looking rather pale, and\n               like it had been stuck on a shelf for quite a\n               while.\n\n                 Although it featured plenty of voice talent\n               (Gilda Radner, Billy Crystal and Harry Shearer),\n               Animalympics never got the exposure intended for\n               it. Originally commissioned by NBC as two separate\n               shows for each of the Olympics in 1980, only the\n               winter special aired. The other half was pulled\n               from the Moscow Summer Olympics, along with all\n               US athletes, due to Jimmy Carter's boycott of\n               the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Who could have\n               known the US would find themselves occupying it\n               just a couple decades later? Anyhow, the two parts\n               were instead edited together into a feature length\n               animation piece, and although it saw very limited\n               theatrical release, it did well in the home video\n               market. While it was never regarded as much of\n               a success, several of its key animators went on\n               to do great things: Roger Allers directed The Lion\n               King, Bill Kroyer wrote and directed FernGully, \n          and, Brad bird wrote and directed The Incredibles   \n           and Ratatouille. Many talented animators worked       \n             on this, and it shows.                                 \n                                                                   \n              For your added entertainment, we also threw in     \n         a 27 min long interview Steven Lisberger did with    \n         himself upon the release of the DVD, which goes       \n            into explaining many of the things we've already         \n             outlined above.                                       \n                                                                  \n                                                               \n                                            \n                                                 \n                      -+ Who We Are +-                  \n                                                                   \n                                                                    \n            Since 2003, FLAiR has been dedicated to pres-          \n           erving the neglected titles of an entertainment            \n            era long gone. A time of classic kids flicks,               \n          painstaking hand-drawn animation and countless            \n             cheesy low-budget horrors. A time when pop had             \n              a King, and rock had a Queen. A time when special\n              FX wizards ruled, and CGI was just one of their\n              many tools.\n\n                Driven by nostalgia and memories of better\n              days, we seek to relive those times, and share\n              those memories. While our belief is that the\n              80s represent the very pinnacle of pop culture,\n              we will not limit ourselves to one decade, or\n              any single genre. We will not ignore the movies\n              considered insignificant or even embarrassing by\n              the studios. We will not disregard a timepiece\n              just because it is dated.\n\n                Whereas most groups rely soley on digital\n              sources, there are still thousands of rare and\n              out of print titles, many of which have no\n              planned digital release. We've made it our\n              mission to dig these out, clean them up using\n              the best hardware and techniques available to\n              us, and share them with the world. Be it VHS,\n              Laserdisc or more exotic formats, we're here\n              to bring you the best (and worst!) of decades\n           past. So sit back and enjoy as we uncover and             \n           pay tribute to an age of cinema we will never           \n         get back.                                               \n                                                                     \n                                                               \n                                                     \n                                     \n                                                 \n                                                 \n                           -+  Respect  +-                  \n                                                            \n                                                                \n                 AEN  AEROHOLiCS  ALLiANCE  ARTHOUSE            \n                                                                \n                BLooDWeiSeR  EPiC  EPiSODE  FiCO  FLS           \n                                                                \n              FRAGMENT  HkM  HUMANiSM  KYR  MEMETiC  QiX        \n                                                                 \n                SAPHiRE  TheWretched  VH-PROD  VoMiT  xV         \n                                                                 \n                                                                 \n                Gone But Not Forgotten       \n                                                                 \n                 SiCK  Cheetah-TV  CuNT  BlooDLiTE  TCF          \n                                                                 \n                                                                 \n                   and everyone who truly contributes            \n                                                                 \n                                                              \n       \n                                             \n                  ascii: asphyx!LGF!CPH!SAC!ACiD 2002","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54a91902b5a845beff2240ac0fa78939f25099a1","amp;dn":"Animalympics.1980.DVDRip.XviD-FLAiR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54a91902b5a845beff2240ac0fa78939f25099a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,169,25,2,181,168,69,190,255,34,64,172,15,167,137,57,242,80,153,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
