A trailer for the game released at the Entertainment Software Association's 2009 Electronic Entertainment Expo indicates that the story takes place twenty-five years after the conclusion of Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, and centers on the breakdown of peaceful relations between the United Earth Federation, the Aeon Illuminate, and the Cybran Nation, implying that war has been instigated through a single bullet. Supreme commander 2 is more focused on conflicting characters rather than ideologies.\n\n\nMinimum System Requirements :\n=============================\n\nWindows XP/Vista/Windows 7\nProcessor: 2.0 GHz or better,  Intel or AMD CPU\nMemory: 1GB RAM (XP) 1GB RAM (Vista / Win 7)\nVideo: 256 MB VRAM DX9 compliant with Pixel Shader 2.0 w/ instancing support\nDirectX support: DirectX 9.0\nSound: No accelerated sound hardware required\nHard Drive: 2-3 GB, for full install &amp; DirectX\nInternet Connection with Cable / Broadband\n\n\n\n\n                       \n                                ***** enjoy ... *****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:029b8de98fa8e92186049508c0cd21b0aae28738","amp;dn":"PC+%C3%82%C2%BB+SUPREME+COMMANDER+2+Full+Game+directplay+by+globe%40","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"029b8de98fa8e92186049508c0cd21b0aae28738","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,155,141,233,143,168,233,33,134,4,149,8,192,205,33,176,170,226,135,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
