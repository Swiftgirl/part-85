Ward  (guitar, production). The pair first met in 2006 for a movie soundtrack project for the film ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The Go-GetterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ in which they recorded a version of Richard and Linda ThompsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhen I Get To The BorderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Their first studio album, Volume One, was released in March of 2008 on Merge Records. Their second studio album, Volume Two, will be released March 23, 2010 which is just over two years since the release of Volume One. According to Merge, at their initial studio session the two ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwere immediately struck by one anotherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s talents and found an instant rapportÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. During a conversation about their shared love of old records, Zooey let slip that she wrote her own songs, which she recorded alone at home on her computer. Somewhat shy about sharing these musical morsels, she was eventually persuaded to send them to M. He was instantly impressed, and they soon reconvened at his Portland, Oregon, United States studio to begin work. Recorded over a period of several months, between acting work (She) and touring commitments (Him), the pair found time to bring ZooeyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fledgling songs to gorgeous fruition.\n(from Lastfm)\n\n\n\n\n01.
