There's Deb, the girl who keeps showing up with her crap on the front porch. There's Kip, Napoleon's geek brother who's searching for love. There's Rico, Napoleon's jock uncle who just seems to want to ruin Napoleon's life. And then Pedro shows up. The new kid in town. He's from Mexico, he has an awesome bike, and he's the only kid in school with a mustache. When Napoleon befriends Pedro, and Pedro decides to run for class president, Napoleon gets his chance to show his stuff and prove that he's got nothing to prove. \n\nWritten by Isaac\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f3f225682c7253be35c30b02fa884a388a4c20c","amp;dn":"Napoleon+Dynamite+-+DVDRip+-+ar.tur","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f3f225682c7253be35c30b02fa884a388a4c20c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,63,34,86,130,199,37,59,227,92,48,176,47,168,132,163,136,164,194,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
