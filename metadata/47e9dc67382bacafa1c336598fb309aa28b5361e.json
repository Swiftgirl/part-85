With several years of research and comprehensive information gathering, Jack has a serious understanding of how the Global Super Elite do their business, and delivers a daily analysis of world events with satire and a song.\n\nHe understands and decodes the doublespeak, and groupthink of the mainstream media, and outlines the agenda of those who would seek to kill off or enslave the planet.
