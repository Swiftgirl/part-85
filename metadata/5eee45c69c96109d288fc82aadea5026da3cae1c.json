While in love, Smith must obtain his duties as president of Jamestown fort and challenges to himself what is the better path for himself to take: stay with the fallen apart colony or go up the river and love Pocahontas in the wild. The Indians realize that the English do not mean to leave, so they attack. A few men at the fort decide to capture Pocahontas as a hostage so the Indians will not attack them. Smith is ordered to leave Jamestown by the King, and John Rolfe, a wealthy tobacco planter arrives at the fort. Pocahontas, now living there adapts to the English cultures and falls in love with Rolfe. She falls apart deciding who she is dedicated to, Smith or Rolfe.\n\nWas nominated for Oscar.\n\nExtended Cut (172 min)\n\n\nScreens: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/gAJObaAcG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/gAJObaAcG&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/hAJOgaAcG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/hAJOgaAcG&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/haJOpAACg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/haJOpAACg&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5eee45c69c96109d288fc82aadea5026da3cae1c","amp;dn":"The+New+World+2005+Extended+Cut+172min+BRRip+H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5eee45c69c96109d288fc82aadea5026da3cae1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,238,69,198,156,150,16,157,40,143,200,42,173,234,80,38,218,60,174,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
