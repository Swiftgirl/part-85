They were a small Minnesotan band that were active 2005-2009 and called it quits in January 2009. I'm uploading everything I have from them for you guys :)\n\nAlbums included are We Own The Skies and The Mesoamerican Dream. WOTS is in 320 kbps MP3 files and TMD is in 256 kbps M4A files.\n\n\nThe Men Who Control The Weather are a subversive paramilitary dance-rock band. From their headquarters in Minneapolis, Minnesota they take to the highways of America, seeking to undermine ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“the manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and bring truth to the good citizens of our country. Conspiracies, alien abduction, zombies, the end of the world - if itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s weird theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll expose it, and theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll do it with style. With roots in punk, experimental and good old fashioned rock and roll music, The Men Who Control the Weather produce a sound like no other. Their tongue-in-cheek, grandiose, visions of impending doom are contrasted by their upbeat, danceable rhythms and their wild attitude. Zany synthesizers conspire with hard rock guitar to create the impression that TMWCTW are creating the soundtrack to a sci-fi flick from the 1950ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s. The Men Who Control the WeatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lineup that you see before you today has been carefully crafted to create an elite mix of musical talent and military skill. These men have become the A-Team of rock music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e928fa74fc1a990d88890e2abc55b2dea56f5849","amp;dn":"The+Men+Who+Control+The+Weather+-+2+albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e928fa74fc1a990d88890e2abc55b2dea56f5849","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,40,250,116,252,26,153,13,136,137,14,42,188,85,178,222,165,111,88,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
