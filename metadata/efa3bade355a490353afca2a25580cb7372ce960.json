Delving into the darker, twisted side of Electro/Techno. Big thrashy synths and crazy production fill these tracks with an air of insanity. Both tracks have been causing serious damage in festivals the world and featured on Noisias Fabric Mix CD. Some consider this style a religious experience, others consider it a cardiovascular workout, its safe to say you will be liberated from a world of mundane Electro trash. This yet another an amazing release from Noisia and Division as they take electro breaks to a whole other level.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efa3bade355a490353afca2a25580cb7372ce960","amp;dn":"Feed+Me+and+Noisia%3A+Mordez+Moi%2FB.R.U.L+%28DIVISION003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efa3bade355a490353afca2a25580cb7372ce960","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,163,186,222,53,90,73,3,83,175,202,42,37,88,12,183,55,44,233,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
