It was created by, and the first six series were written by, Rob Grant and Doug Naylor. The show originated from a recurring sketch, Dave Hollins: Space Cadet part of the mid-1980s BBC Radio 4 comedy show Son of ClichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, also scripted by Grant and Naylor. In addition to the television episodes, there are four bestselling novels, two pilot episodes for an American version of the show, a radio version produced for BBC radio 7, tie-in books, magazines and other merchandise.\n\nDespite the pastiche of science fiction used as a backdrop, Red Dwarf is primarily a character-driven comedy, with off-the-wall science fiction elements used as complementary plot devices. In the early episodes, a recurring source of comedy was the &quot;Odd Couple&quot;-style relationship between the two central characters of the show, who have an intense dislike for each other but are trapped together deep in space. The main characters are Dave Lister, the last known human alive, and Arnold Rimmer, a hologram of Lister's dead bunkmate. The other regular characters are Cat, a lifeform that evolved from Lister's pet cat; Holly, Red Dwarf's computer; and, as of Series III, Kryten, a service mechanoid.\n\n\n\nRead by Chris Barrie\n\nRed Dwarf - S01 - E01 - Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers\nRed Dwarf - S01 - E02 - Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers\nRed Dwarf - S01 - E03 - Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers\nRed Dwarf - S01 - E04 - Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers\nRed Dwarf - S01 - E05 - Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers\nRed Dwarf - S01 - E06 - Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers\n\nRed Dwarf - S02 - E01 - Better Than Life\nRed Dwarf - S02 - E02 - Better Than Life\nRed Dwarf - S02 - E03 - Better Than Life\nRed Dwarf - S02 - E04 - Better Than Life\nRed Dwarf - S02 - E05 - Better Than Life\nRed Dwarf - S02 - E06 - Better Than Life\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration Approx : 27mn 54s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cfa02847a48e1100c90cf4ed3b3b991258e12c3","amp;dn":"Red+Dwarf+-+AudioBooks+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cfa02847a48e1100c90cf4ed3b3b991258e12c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,250,2,132,122,72,225,16,12,144,207,78,211,179,185,145,37,142,18,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
