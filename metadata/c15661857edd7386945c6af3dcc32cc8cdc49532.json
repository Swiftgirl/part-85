To change options execute the PSO options shortcut, but don't play from it. It will lead to somewhere else.\n\n\n\nInfo:\n\nIn the Extras folder are the stuff I've installed. Just included them if you want to revert to original. Plus there are the original PSO execs, if you want them.\n\nIn the ExtrasWindowed are the executables for runing PSO in windowed mode. Just copy them to the main folder.\n\nI've also included exec for Vista and win7 users.\n\nAlso remember that these execs are ippatches to my ip. To patch it to somewhere else just run the included ippatch.exe .\n\n\n\n/Best regarde Frezzno\n\n\nLast changes notes:\n\nForgot to mention that extra good sound was also installed. All data was taken from PSO Palace. All cudos to them and none to me what so ever.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c15661857edd7386945c6af3dcc32cc8cdc49532","amp;dn":"Phantasy+Star+Online+v2+-+Frezzno+Server+no+Jap+installation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c15661857edd7386945c6af3dcc32cc8cdc49532","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,86,97,133,126,221,115,134,148,92,106,243,220,195,44,200,205,196,149,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
