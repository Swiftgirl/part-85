The Bar Association boss represents lawyers' interests, and he  advances those by keeping low-cost competition out.\n\nAlso, lots of licensed lawyers cheat people and make mistakes. One Connecticut lawyer  accumulated 44 complaints before the state revoked his license . In one of his cases, he cost his client $2,600 and crippled her credit rating by failing to pay a $900 tax bill.\n\nOn my show tonight at 8 and 11 ET, as I mentioned earlier, I'll interview David Price, a Kansas City paralegal who went to jail for half a year because he helped 86- year old Eldon Ray write a letter defending himself against the charge of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œunlicensed practice of architecture.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nLicensing laws have a chilling effect on innovation, and that means consumers pay more. According to U. Minnesota public policy professor Morris Kleiner, licensing laws cost between $34.8 and $41.7 billion a year -- on the low end, that's more than $100 for every American.\n\nWisconsin citizens are fortunate that their state has a weak &quot;unlicensed practice of law&quot; statute.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58359584bf86a5f57b6e2eb614a38b74b2136770","amp;dn":"20100311-Stossel-%5BLicensing+Madness%5D.Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58359584bf86a5f57b6e2eb614a38b74b2136770","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,53,149,132,191,134,165,245,123,110,46,182,20,163,139,116,178,19,103,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
