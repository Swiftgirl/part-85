The tool is called PE Guard and keeps running in the background in the system tray without consuming much of the memory space.\n\nThe tool can be chosen to run in wither normal Guard mode or the Power Guard mode. As the name suggests, Power Guard mode is more powerful and protects the computer and files better. It can detect and thus protect when the virus is trying to replicate itself in the system and when it is trying to infect the system exe or sys files.\n\nThe tool is free and whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more it do not require any update of the definitions like the Anti Virus software.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e16ffa3f8ecb6b54e221790d0f2bc2eb819319f","amp;dn":"PE+guard","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e16ffa3f8ecb6b54e221790d0f2bc2eb819319f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,22,255,163,248,236,182,181,78,34,23,144,208,242,188,46,184,25,49,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
