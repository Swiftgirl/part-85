This appears to be the best sounding and flowing mix yet to be made, and it contains what is probably the closest thing to a crisp, stereo recording of 'Good Vibrations' that we'll probably ever see. This was made using Brian Wilson's 2004 version as a model.\n\nThis album is, in my opinion, even better than Pet Sounds, and should be heard by anyone with an open mind. Please seed!\n\n\n\n\n***These files are all in 320 kbps mp3 format.***","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d572cf4adfde5a445112647c3fc362f038fdef39","amp;dn":"SMiLE+%28Mattix%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d572cf4adfde5a445112647c3fc362f038fdef39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,114,207,74,223,222,90,68,81,18,100,124,63,195,98,240,56,253,239,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
