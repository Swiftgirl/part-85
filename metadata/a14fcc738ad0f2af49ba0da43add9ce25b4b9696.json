Depends libglib\n\nusage:\n\nengine used_tags input output\n\nan input file could look like this\n        \n          Text used \n          Text unused \n        Always used\n         unused  still unused  \n         Hello  goodbye  \n\nused_tags could look like this\n      use this\n      and this\n      more\n      whatever\n\noutput would look like this\n      Text used\n      Always used\n      Hello\n\nSo it can be used in programming and publishing when you are unsure if an element will be there or if an either or is need but your not sure which and you don't want to erase anything.\n\nGive me suggestions.  I'll be switching input &amp; output to stdin &amp; stdout.\n\nAbout me and my torrents:\n  I'm here to start doing torrents smarter.  If you know any torrents that you would like done smarter leave me a comment.  We have 17 of the top trackers in this torrent.  I also have made it so it organizes smarter.  I do have a policy on leechers.  Just seed it to a ratio of 3. Just set the download to do that automatically. If it sits around for a week then stop seeding.  Also if you can learn about port forwarding then do so.\t\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a14fcc738ad0f2af49ba0da43add9ce25b4b9696","amp;dn":"publisher%5C%27s+xml+parser+%5Bengine-1.0%5D+%5BJasonofCompsci%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a14fcc738ad0f2af49ba0da43add9ce25b4b9696","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,79,204,115,138,208,242,175,73,186,13,164,58,221,156,226,91,75,150,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
