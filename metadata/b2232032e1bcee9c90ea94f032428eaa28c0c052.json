Would such an innovation work in America?\n\n\n\nIn the capital of Kigali, NOW's David Brancaccio sits down with Rwandan President Paul Kagame to talk about international aid and Kagame's ultimate vision for a healthy, financially-independent Rwanda.\n\n\n\nThis show is part of Enterprising Ideas, NOW's continuing spotlight on social entrepreneurs working to improve the world through self-sustaining innovation.\n\n\n\nThis show was originally broadcast on September 11, 2009.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2232032e1bcee9c90ea94f032428eaa28c0c052","amp;dn":"Africa%3A+House+Calls+and+Health+Care-Now+on+PBS-12+18+09","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2232032e1bcee9c90ea94f032428eaa28c0c052","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,35,32,50,225,188,238,156,144,234,148,240,50,66,142,170,40,192,192,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
