Mentioned by Lennon in a 1975 interview, details were brought to light in May Pang's 1983 book, Loving John, and it gained wider prominence when McCartney made reference to the session in a 1997 interview. Discussing with Australian writer Sean Sennett in his Soho office, McCartney claimed the &quot;session was hazy... for a number of reasons&quot;. The story is corroborated by biographies such as Christopher Sandford's 2006 McCartney.&quot;\n\nVERRRRRRRY hazy, but good for novelty's sake","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62f9eacdbeadf38de191128348b5b56fe35dfdca","amp;dn":"John+Lennon+%26+Paul+McCartney+-+A+Toot+And+A+Snore+In+%5C%2774","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62f9eacdbeadf38de191128348b5b56fe35dfdca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,249,234,205,190,173,243,141,225,145,18,131,72,181,181,111,227,93,253,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
