The boy soon discovers               \n    that his trip won't be as easy as he                       \n    imagined... The community of struggling                    \n    illegal aliens in Calais is captured with              \n        authenticity, from the point of view of                \n        people who arrived there knowing nothing               \n        about France. This immigrant drama, with               \n    wonderful performances by the actors, is a             \n    strong story which uses documentary                    \n    austerity and minimalist style to create a             \n    great emotional impact.                                \n                                                           \n                 \n                                                 \n                                                     \n                                                     \n                                                               \n    Vincent Lindon as Simon                                \n    Firat Ayverdi as Bilal                                 \n        Audrey Dana as Marion                                  \n        Derya Ayverdi as Mina                                  \n        Thierry Godard as Bruno                                \n    Selim Akgul as Zoran (as Selim Akgul)                     \n    Firat Celik as Koban                                       \n    Murat Subasi as Mirko                                      \n    Olivier Rabourdin as Lieutenant Caratini               \n                                                               \n                                                               \n                                                               \n                                                           \n                                                           \n                                                           \n                                                                   \n                                                                   \n                     \n                                            \n                                              \n                                                \n                                                           \n        We are currently doing high quality XviD, TV           \n        and DVD Rips.                                          \n        We are always looking for new talent,                  \n    newbie or pro we want you!                                \n                                                               \n    If u wanna learn to rip quality Xvid or DVD                \n    we can teach you.                                      \n                                                               \n        We are always interested in affiling good              \n        sites in europe or asia.                               \n                                                           \n    IF you think you can provide anything that             \n    could be of use for us (shells, bots, dumps,               \n    coding or anything else you can think of)                  \n       do contact us with an offer we cannot refuse              \n        :-)                                                    \n                                                               \n                                                            \n                                                           \n             \n                                             \n                                                 \n                                                  \n                                                           \n         To all quality minded groups in the scene.            \n               And to all our old members.                     \n                                                               \n             \n                                      \n                                              \n                                               \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n              You can contact us by messaging us.             \n              Where you say?
