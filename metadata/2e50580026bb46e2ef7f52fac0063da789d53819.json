The game includes the Na'vi, Pandora's indigenous people and other life forms. The player controls a marine named Lance Corporal Able Ryder. Soon into the game the player decides to play the RDA or Na'vi. If the player decides to join the Na'vi, the game becomes a third person adventure, and RDA characters are unplayable. If the player chooses to side with the RDA, the game remains a third person shooter, and Navi characters are unplayable. Both types of characters are equipped with their own particular weapons and abilities, with many other weapons and abilities unlockable as the player gains experience (XP) during the game. \n\n[TEXT EXTRACTED FROM WIKIPEDIA]\n\n\n\n Minimum Configuration:\n ======================\n\n  Operating System: WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® XP (with SP2) or Windows VistaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® (with SP1) / 7 \n  Processor:        3 Ghz IntelÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® PentiumÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® D 830\n                    AMD AthlonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢  64 X2 3800+ or better \n  RAM:              1 GB Windows XP / 2 GB Windows Vista, Windows 7\n  Video card:       NVidiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ 6800 or ATIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ X1650 or better  \n                    256 MB DirectXÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 10.0ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“compliant video card or DirectXÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® \n                    9.0cÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“compliant card with Shader Model 3.0 \n  Hard Drive Space: 4 GB\n  Sound:            DirectX 9.0c Compatible Sound Card with Latest Drivers \n\n\n\n\n***** enjoy ... *****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e50580026bb46e2ef7f52fac0063da789d53819","amp;dn":"PC+%C3%82%C2%BB+AVATAR+-+THE+GAME+Full+Game+1.01+directplay+by+globe%40","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e50580026bb46e2ef7f52fac0063da789d53819","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,80,88,0,38,187,70,226,239,127,82,250,192,6,61,167,137,213,56,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
