I not only removed the narrative part of \n\nthese movies, while retaining only the song and dance parts, but I found myself not\n\nliking this result. Many of the numbers are themselves uninteresting. \n\n\nSo, to show you what I've done, I'm including all stages of my winnowing down the\n\noriginal to my final liking. My catagory 3 is the final step which satisfies me.\n\n\nGold Diggers of 1935 is a good example of this. I find it hard to understand what\n\nthe rationale was for them to include a death, or suicide, in what should have \n\nbeen a rousing, inspiriational musical number. Perhaps it was merely an excuse to\n\nlead up to the spiraling down into the clock scene. \n\n\nI spent most of my time concentrating on the two military numbers in Footlight\n\nParade and Gold Diggers of 1933. I think they're marvelous. I am particularly\n\nmoved by My Forgotten Man. I came from that time. I am an 85 year old veteran of\n\nboth World War II and The Korean War.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:459022fce517230a8f9e51dd01a946b093430abd","amp;dn":"Movie+musical+routines+1+update+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"459022fce517230a8f9e51dd01a946b093430abd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,144,34,252,229,23,35,10,143,158,81,221,1,169,70,176,147,67,10,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
