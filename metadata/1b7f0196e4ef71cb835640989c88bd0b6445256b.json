The series was originally aired on BBC 2 from 15 June 1983 to 20 July 1983. \n\n\nSet in 1485 at the end of the British Middle Ages, the series is written as a secret history which contends that King Richard III won the Battle of Bosworth Field, only to be accidentally murdered, and is succeeded by Richard IV, one of the Princes in the Tower. The series follows the exploits of Richard IV's unfavored second son Edmund, the Duke of Edinburgh (who calls himself &quot;The Black Adder&quot;) in his various attempts to increase his standing with his father and his eventual quest to overthrow him.\n\nSeason/series 1: 6 episodes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b7f0196e4ef71cb835640989c88bd0b6445256b","amp;dn":"The+Black+Adder+%28First+series%2C+1983%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b7f0196e4ef71cb835640989c88bd0b6445256b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,127,1,150,228,239,113,203,131,86,64,152,156,136,189,11,100,69,37,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
