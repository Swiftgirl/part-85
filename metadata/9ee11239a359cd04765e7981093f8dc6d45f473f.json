To celebrate the 4th year aniversary of this festival, I am sharing this beautiful set of great animations. I've included The Cat Piano, which would have been a short worthy of winning the next Oscar. Other shorts that are shortlisted for the next Oscar are Granny O Grimm (but be sure to check out the much better sleeping beauty film in this edition, Cloutier's version of sleeping beauty, which was recommended by one of you), naturally a Matter of Loaf and Death by Aardman Studio's, and Farbice Joubert's (he also worked on Wallace and Grommit's latest full feature) French Roast. But don't forget the (perhaps better) animations that have recently appeared. One of my favorites is Skhizein - about a man 91 centimeters out of touch with himself. Excellent story. I've added some classic animations - The Dot and the line, A Romance in Lower Mathematics by Chuck Jones. Great, about the life of angineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, is a great example of Godfrey's style of making animations. He once worked for Larkin animation studio's, but got fired, and started for himself (and see what good came out of it). I've added another flash animation, Stainboy by Tim Burton, based on his characters from his book The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy. I also could not resist adding Nina Paley's copying is not a crime - it is great to see so many animators taking the opportunity of the internet to share there great animations (such as Leslie Supnet, Vladimir Todorovic and The Cat Piano in this edition) for us all to enjoy. Keep sharing!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ee11239a359cd04765e7981093f8dc6d45f473f","amp;dn":"Beltesassar%5C%27s+Short+Animation+Festival+Part+16","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ee11239a359cd04765e7981093f8dc6d45f473f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,225,18,57,163,89,205,4,118,94,121,129,9,63,141,198,212,95,71,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
