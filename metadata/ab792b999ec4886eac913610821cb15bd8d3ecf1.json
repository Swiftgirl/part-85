As with many of their singles, it was written by songwriters Ken Howard and Alan Blaikley, and like many of the group's recordings, it features a novelty element - in this case a trumpet section, and the distinctive sound of a whip cracking in the chorus. The musical accompaniment was directed by John Gregory.\n\n\n\nTaken from Jukebox Saturday Night show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab792b999ec4886eac913610821cb15bd8d3ecf1","amp;dn":"Dave+Dee+-+Legend+Of+Xanadu+%5B1968%5D.mpg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab792b999ec4886eac913610821cb15bd8d3ecf1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,121,43,153,158,196,136,110,172,145,54,16,130,28,177,91,216,211,236,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
