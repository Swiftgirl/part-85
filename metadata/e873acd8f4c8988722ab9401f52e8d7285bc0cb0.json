The band was formed in California in \n1961 by brothers Brian Wilson (b. 1942) on keyboards and bass, Dennis\nWilson (1944 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 83) on drums, and Carl Wilson (1946 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 98) on guitar;\ntheir cousin Mike Love (b. 1941) on drums; and Alan Jardine (b. 1942)\non guitar. \n\nWithin a year they launched a string of surfing-oriented hits marked \nby close vocal harmony, including &quot;Surfin' Safari&quot; and &quot;California Girls.&quot;\n \nBy 1966 they had released more than 10 albums, including Pet Sounds \n(1966), considered their best. Despite Brian Wilson's reclusiveness \ndue to stress- and drug-related breakdowns, the band continued to make\nrecordings into the 1980s and toured into the 1990s.\n\nCourt battles\n_____________\n\nMany legal difficulties developed over the coming years due too Brian Wilsons \npsychological problems. \nIn the early 1980s, the band hired controversial therapist Eugene Landy in an \nattempt to help him. Landy did achieve some significant improvements in Wilsons \noverall condition; from his own admissions about his massive drug intake, it was \nhighly likely that Wilson would have died if Landy had not intervened. \n\nLandy successfully treated Wilson's drug dependence, and by 1988 Wilson had \nrecovered sufficiently to record his first solo album, Brian Wilson. But Landy \nbecame increasingly possessive of his star patient. After accusations that Landy \nwas using his control over Wilson for his own benefit, the band successfully \nentreated the courts to separate Landy from Wilson.\n\nIn addition to the challenges over the use of the bands name and over the best way \nto care for Wilson, there have been three significant legal cases involving \nthe Beach Boys in recent years. \n\nThe second lawsuit stemmed from Wilso's reclamation of his publishing rights,soon \nafter Wilson won his Sea of Tunes case in 1989, Mike Love discovered Murry Wilson\ndid not properly credit him as co-writer on dozens of Beach Boys songs, including \n&quot;California Girls&quot;, &quot;Catch a Wave,&quot; &quot;I Get Around,&quot; &quot;When I Grow Up (To Be a Man),&quot;\n&quot;Be True to Your School,&quot; &quot;Help Me, Rhonda,&quot; &quot;I Know There's an Answer,&quot; and \nnumerous others. \n\nWith Mike and Brian unable to determine exactly what Mike was properly owed, Mike \nsued Brian in 1992 to gain credit for his co-authorship of a number of important \nBeach Boys songs, winning $13 million in 1994 for lost royalties. In interviews, \nMike revealed that on some songs he wrote most of the lyrics, on others only a \nline or two. \nEven though Mike sued Brian, both parties said in interviews that there was no \nmalice between them; they simply couldn't come up with an agreeable settlement by \nthemselves.\n\nHowever in November 2005, Love filed yet another lawsuit against Brian Wilson and \nhis management, love alleged that the UK publication The Mail on Sunday and WilsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \nrepresentatives gave the false impression to the readers of The Mail on Sunday that \ntheir joint promotional giveaway of nearly three million copies of the CD called \nGood Vibrations was authorized by Mike Love and the Beach Boys. \n\nThis free CD, Love alleged, includes five of Love and WilsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s co-authored hit \nBeach Boys songs, and was done to promote Wilson's solo CD, Smile. Love also \nclaimed that Smile and Good Vibrations were marketed using the Beach BoysÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ names \nand images without permission. The complaint sought several million dollars in \ndamages, and also a million dollars to cover costs of advertising to correct the \nperceived &quot;damage to the band's reputation&quot;.\n\nLove's 2005 lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice on May 10, 2007 as to all the \ndefendants, including Wilson. In a series of rulings, the court rejected all of Loves \nclaims, including the claim that Smile was a Beach Boys project as to which Love \ndeserved compensation from Wilson directly, the court subsequently ruled that Love had \nto pay the legal fees of all the defendants as well.\n\n_________\n\n 1.
