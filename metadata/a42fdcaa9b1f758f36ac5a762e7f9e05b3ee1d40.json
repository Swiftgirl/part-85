Most Weezer fans know that: the Special Goodness is his band, and has put out a few records over the years, the first of which I think is a freakin' awesome record. The band's newest album, Land Air Sea, has been out for about a year now, but has now been released under Epitaph and remastered.\n\nWilson is a really good guitarist, and his songwriting isn't shabby either. Songs like the single &quot;Life Goes By&quot; perfectly showcases this: very catchy, yet very precise. Wilson definitely has an ear for melody, and for good guitar crunch. He perfectly melds pop and rock into a very distinct sounding record.\n\n&quot;Day In the Autumn,&quot; is a slower, though more powerful song that kind of swings back and forth in melody. Atom Willard's drums are potent, and give a deep and controlled wallop to the beat. &quot;NFA&quot; is a fun song that has interesting breaks and switches from verse to chorus.\n\nThere are a few &quot;older&quot; songs on the record as well; a perfect example is &quot;Pay No Mind.&quot; Though from SG's first, this is a newer, fuller version and stands out well as the album's closer. Wilson uses great skill in his solos and bridges, and his voice is definitely unique.\n\nLand Air Sea is by far a solid record. Patrick Wilson, along with his buddy Atom, has made a collection of well crafted, meaningful songs that say something and are fun all at once. It's kind of rare these days to hear a record like this. The care taken, the overall goodness is, wellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ ok, I have to say it, &quot;special.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a42fdcaa9b1f758f36ac5a762e7f9e05b3ee1d40","amp;dn":"The+Special+Goodness+-+Land+Sea+Air","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a42fdcaa9b1f758f36ac5a762e7f9e05b3ee1d40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,47,220,170,155,31,117,143,54,172,90,118,46,127,158,5,179,238,29,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
