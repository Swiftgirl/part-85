With it you can fully edit the careers in The Sims. It is supposed to work on all installations of The Sims. You can change job properties, change job transfers and bonuses, change the icons of the career track, change the texts of the careers and exchange careers with your friends. The only thing you can't do is ADD new careers: you have to REPLACE existing careers with your own creations. This is because of the way The Sims works and there is currently no way around it.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63dc8bacb2c570c8049edd4aa6f46f1de462423a","amp;dn":"The+Sims+Career+Creator+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63dc8bacb2c570c8049edd4aa6f46f1de462423a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,220,139,172,178,197,112,200,4,158,221,74,166,244,111,29,228,98,66,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
