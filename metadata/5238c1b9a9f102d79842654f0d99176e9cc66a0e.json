Pulling strings, he arranges to accompany NYPD Detective Kate Beckett (Stana Katic), claiming he wants to study and use her as a personality basis for his next book series. But their personalities don't mesh -- Castle's fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants detective style greatly clashes with Beckett's more conservative and methodical approach to the crimes, but the new life that Castle has begun couldn't have been scripted better by himself.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5238c1b9a9f102d79842654f0d99176e9cc66a0e","amp;dn":"Castle+2009+Seson+2+%5BHDTV.XviD-XOR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5238c1b9a9f102d79842654f0d99176e9cc66a0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,56,193,185,169,241,2,215,152,66,101,79,13,153,23,110,156,198,106,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
