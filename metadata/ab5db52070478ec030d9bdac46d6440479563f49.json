This is just the GiveAwayOfTheDay.com program for today. Get it while it lasts. And after it use the Recovered Setup file...\n\n\nDiscRipper is a software program which simply does two jobs: ripping audio CD and DVD video discs.\n\nDiscRipper can rip DVD disc into MPEG4, AVI, WMV, XVid, and many other formats. Also, DiscRipper can convert video for portable devices such as iPod, iPhone, PSP, Creative Zen, and 3GP / 3G2 for mobile phones. You can select preferred DVD titles, audio language and subtitles if available on a DVD disc. Furthermore, you can freely configure the output format by changing video / audio bitrate, frame rate, frame size, and other options.\n\nBesides ripping DVD video, with this little but powerful program you can backup your audio CD into MP3 format, rip CD into APE files, OGG or WAV audio file formats. DiscRipper will automatically fetch all CD tracks information from CDDB internet database; grab album covers and even lyrics for all songs. All this information will be stored in mp3 tags (both Id3v1 and Id3v2, so there is no need to do that manually anymore).\n\n\nMore infos at\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.giveawayoftheday.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.giveawayoftheday.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nuclear-coffee.com/DiscRipper&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nuclear-coffee.com/DiscRipper&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nThe Portable SFX EXE file is built up using WinRAR. You can use it to extract the files and check them one by one if you want to be sure of what is running on your machine.\n\n\nThis has also been built on an XP x86 machine, I don't know if this program can run on a x64 or Vista machine. I't's up to you to check it if you are using them.\n\n\n\nSUGGESTIONS ON USING P2P DOWNLOADS\n==================================\n\n1) It's always better to run all downloaded programs using Sandboxie or a similar virtual machine until you are sure they are clean.\n\n\n2) When in doubt, scan them with an Internet Scan service as the ones provided by Jotti and VirusTotal\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://virusscan.jotti.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://virusscan.jotti.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.virustotal.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.virustotal.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis will ***NOT*** give you any warranty that a file passing their analysis is clean, nor that if they see them as a troian it's so or not just another false positive, but helps you to decide and at least ask for help or infos.\n\n\n3) Remember, trust nobody, and when in doubt, go to point 1) \n\n\n4) If you find any upload containing trojans or whatsoever malicious or unclean, instead of start cursing in the comments of the upload, take the time to go to the Suprbay Forum at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nand report links and comments there, and someone will take care of all the nasties.\n\n\nThat's the only way to keep TPB and its uploads fresh and clean.\n\n\nThat's for what is regarding security. If after testing it you like it and it's useful for you, show your support buying it!\n\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab5db52070478ec030d9bdac46d6440479563f49","amp;dn":"DiskRipper+v1.0.0.20+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab5db52070478ec030d9bdac46d6440479563f49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,93,181,32,112,71,142,192,48,217,189,172,70,214,68,4,121,86,63,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
