The show's central character is Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), an unconventional, maverick medical genius who heads a team of diagnosticians at the fictional Princeton Plainsboro Teaching Hospital (PPTH) in New Jersey. The character has similarities to Sherlock Holmes: both are forensic geniuses, musicians, drug users, aloof, and largely friendless.\n\nSeason 2 - 24 episodes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48fd0b2bc718f328126690c1a886ffbe1f52efdf","amp;dn":"House%2C+MD+-+Season+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48fd0b2bc718f328126690c1a886ffbe1f52efdf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,253,11,43,199,24,243,40,18,102,144,193,168,134,255,190,31,82,239,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
