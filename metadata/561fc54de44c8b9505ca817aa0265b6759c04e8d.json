It is Feist's most successful single to date. The original song was written by Sally Seltmann, an Australian singer-songwriter who records under the name New Buffalo, and Feist added and rewrote parts of the lyrics.\n\nIn an interview with Songfacts, Seltmann said:\n\n \t&quot;I had been listening to Feist's album Let It Die. I thought my little song about lost love, and the hope to recapture what you once had, sounded too much like a Feist song for me to use for New Buffalo, so I shelved it. Then, in late 2005 I did a tour across Canada supporting Feist, and Broken Social Scene. After meeting Feist, I started to wonder whether she might like to do a cover of &quot;1234,&quot; but I was too shy to tell her about it. At the last Broken Social Scene show, I plucked up the courage to tell her that I had written a song which I thought she might like to use. We went onto the tour bus, and I recorded a simple version of the song into her laptop, with guitar and vocals. To my surprise, she loved the song, and started playing it live.&quot;\n\nOn 14 December 2005, Feist played the song live at The Trabendo in Paris, France in a show broadcast on Europe2 TV, with the title Sally's Song and with somewhat different lyrics than in the commercially released version.\n\n&quot;1234&quot; was nominated for Grammy Awards in the categories of Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Best Short Form Music Video. Likewise, the success of the song largely contributed to Feist's other nominations that year for Best New Artist and Best Pop Vocal Album.This song was #19 on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Best Songs of 2007. &quot;1234&quot; also won the Juno award for Single of the Year on 6 April 2008 in Calgary. Pitchfork Media deemed the video the fifth best video of the decade.\n\nSince its digital release, &quot;1234&quot; peaked at #2 at the US Hot Digital Songs. The single has also reached #8 in the US Hot 100, #10 at the US Pop 100, and #34 at the US Modern Rock Tracks chart. The single's unexpected success led to its release worldwide. In the UK it proved to become a huge hit, making it in the top 10 peaking at #8. It had a very successful release in Canada making it at number 2. The song has also entered the top 10 in other European countries. The single's success has made Feist famous globally and it has boosted the remaining sales. It also managed to debut at number 67 on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart, as digital tracks were added from the 5th of November 2007 to the singles chart in Australia. It later entered the top 50 of the chart in late December, and has thus far peaked at #36.\n\nIt also ranked as the #4 single of 2007 on CBC Radio 3's year-end R3-30 chart and placed at number 34 in the Triple J Hottest 100\n\nTime magazine named &quot;1234&quot; one of The 10 Best Songs of 2007, ranking it at #2 after &quot;Rehab&quot; by Amy Winehouse. Writer Josh Tyrangiel called the song a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmasterpieceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, praising Feist for singing it ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwith a mixture of wisdom and exuberance that's all her own.&quot;\n\nIn the 28 April 2008 episode of The Colbert Report where she was a guest, Feist said that she had planned to offer &quot;1234&quot; as the official campaign theme for Stephen Colbert's Presidential bid, before he dropped out.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:561fc54de44c8b9505ca817aa0265b6759c04e8d","amp;dn":"Feist+-+1234+%28Live%29++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"561fc54de44c8b9505ca817aa0265b6759c04e8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,31,197,77,228,76,139,149,5,202,129,122,160,38,91,103,89,192,78,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
