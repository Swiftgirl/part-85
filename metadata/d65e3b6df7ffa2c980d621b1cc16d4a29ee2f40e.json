His company M.A.R.S. sells four warheads to NATO, and NATO troops are tasked with delivering the warheads. Duke (Channing Tatum) and Ripcord (Marlon Wayans) are delivering the warheads when they are ambushed by The Baroness (Sienna Miller), whom Duke recognizes to be his ex-fiancee Ana Lewis. Duke and Ripcord are rescued by Scarlett (Rachel Nichols), Snake Eyes (Ray Park), Breaker (SaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯d Taghmaoui) and Heavy Duty (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). They take the warheads to The Pit, G.I. Joe's command center in Egypt, and upon arriving rendezvous with the head of The G.I. Joe Team, General Hawk (Dennis Quaid). Hawk takes command of the warheads and excuses Duke and Ripcord, only to be convinced to let them join his group after Duke reveals that he knows The Baroness.\n\nMcCullen is revealed to be using the same nanotechnology to build an army of soldiers with the aid of The Doctor (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), planning on using the warheads to cause panic and bring about a new world order. Using a tracking device, McCullen locates The G.I. Joe Base and sends Storm Shadow (Byung Hun-Lee) and The Baroness to retrieve the warheads with assistance from Zartan (Arnold Vosloo). After a fight, Storm Shadow and The Baroness retrieve the warheads and take them to Baron DeCobray, The Baroness's husband, for him to weaponize. Making their way to Paris, The Joes pursue The Baroness and Storm Shadow but are unsuccessful in stopping them from launching the missile. The nanomites destroy The Eiffel Tower and some of the surrounding area before Duke manages to hit the kill switch, but in doing so he is captured and taken to McCullen's base under The Arctic.\n\nThe Joes locate the secret base and fly there as McCullen loads three missiles with nano-mite warheads. After Snake Eyes takes out one, Ripcord pursues the remaining missiles in a stolen M.A.R.S. prototype Night Raven jet while Scarlett, Breaker, and Snake Eyes infiltrate the base. Snake Eyes duels and prevails over Storm Shadow. Duke learns that The Doctor is Rex Lewis, Ana's brother believed to have been killed by a mistimed airstrike during a mission led by Duke. Rex had encountered Doctor Mindbender (Kevin O'Connor) in the bunker and became seduced with the nanomite technology, taking too long to retrieve the data and getting caught in the bombing which disfigured him. After freeing Duke, The Baroness gets subdued as The Doctor reveals he has implanted her with nano-mites which has put her under his control for the past four years. Attempting to kill Duke, McCullen ends up being burned so he and The Doctor flee to an escape vessel. Duke and The Baroness pursue him while The Joes fall back when The Doctor activated the base's self destruct sequence.\n\nThe Doctor assumes the identity of Cobra Commander, having healed McCullen's burned face with nanomites, encasing it in silver and christening him as &quot;Destro&quot;, which places McCullen under the Doctor's control. They are captured by G.I. Joe soon after. On the supercarrier USS Flagg, The Baroness is placed in protective custody until they can remove the nanomites from her body. Meanwhile, Zartan, having had his physical appearance altered by nanomites, infiltrates The White House during the missile crisis and assumes the identity of the President of the United States of America (Jonathan Pryce).\n\n\n\n\n\nCast: Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Christopher Eccleston, Joseph Gordon-Levitt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                              000000\n                                            0000000000\n                                          000000   00000\n                   000000               000000      000000\n                 0000000000            00000          00000\n               000000   00000         00000            00000\n              00000       00000      00000              00000\n             00000                   0000                0000\n00000000   00000                     0000                0000\n00000000   00000                     0000                0000\n00000000   00000                     0000                0000\n00000000    00000                    0000                0000\n              00000                  0000                0000\n               0000000               0000                0000\n                 000000000           0000                0000\n00000000              000000         0000                0000\n00000000                00000        0000                0000\n00000000                 00000       0000                0000\n00000000                  00000      0000                0000\n00000000                  00000      0000                0000\n00000000                  00000      0000                0000\n00000000                 00000       0000                0000\n00000000   00000        00000        0000                0000\n00000000    00000      00000         0000                0000\n00000000      00000   00000          0000                0000\n00000000        000000000            00000              00000\n00000000          00000               000000          000000\n00000000                               000000        000000\n                                         000000    000000\n                                           000000000000\n                                             00000000","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d65e3b6df7ffa2c980d621b1cc16d4a29ee2f40e","amp;dn":"G.I.Joe.The.Rise.Of.Cobra%5B2009%5D++iSO+Man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d65e3b6df7ffa2c980d621b1cc16d4a29ee2f40e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,94,59,109,247,255,162,201,128,214,33,177,204,22,212,162,158,226,244,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
