A mischievous and unlikely hero, only de Blob can flip, bounce and smash his way past the all-powerful I.N.K.T. Corporation to ignite a revolution and save Chroma City from a future without color. \nBattle against massive tank battalions, speedy I.N.K.T. racers and elite Inky soldiers on your quest to free the citizens of Chroma City.

Join the Color Revolutionaries to refine your skills while making a mess. The race to rescue Chroma City has just begun, and only de Blob can save the world from a black-and-white future.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1aaee741706065e56d7455b561b8a787e68d2f20","amp;dn":"De+Blob+%5BPAL%5D+%5BWiiTorrentZ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1aaee741706065e56d7455b561b8a787e68d2f20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,174,231,65,112,96,101,229,109,116,85,181,97,184,167,135,230,141,47,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
