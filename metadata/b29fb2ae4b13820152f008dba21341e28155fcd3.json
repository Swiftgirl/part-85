Fashion, politics, health, quality of life all show up as Dublin Community Television brings its own unique style of media making to the issue. Visually arresting, we see how Dublin compares to London and Amsterdam and hear voices from all strata and corners of our city.\n\nThe Pedal project is not a documentary ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ it is an ongoing debate emerging into public view in all its complexity and variety for the first time.
