The team that\ncarries the ball into the opponent's end zone scores a touchdown,\nthe team with the most touchdowns at the end of the game is the\nwinner. However, it's how you decide to do this that makes things\ninteresting, the ends justify the means! It's not just the players\nyou have at your disposal either. You can bribe the referee's to\nlook the other way as you cripple or trample annoying opponents and\nhire illegal wizards to give you a hand directly from the crowd...\nBlood Bowl severely tests the finest tacticians' strategies There\nare many races to accommodate every player's profile and even more\nstrategies for experimenting. Winning a game requires a strong\ngame-sense and a lot of self-control. For the player's enjoyment,\nomnipresent humor and the use of spells, weapons, and other\nnon-regulatory means place Blood Bowl outside of the classic sport\nsimulation genre.\n\n____________________________________________________________________ _ _\n+-RELEASE.NOTES\n\nPlayable Regions: NTSC/U\n\nVerified with abgx360\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n++ RRoD - Right when you least expect it! ++----------------'","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccbd666674d1d2364981526a746a76946cdf6f09","amp;dn":"Blood_Bowl_NTSC-XBOX360-RRoD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccbd666674d1d2364981526a746a76946cdf6f09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,189,102,102,116,209,210,54,73,129,82,106,116,106,118,148,108,223,111,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
