Referred to as the King of Pop, he is the most commercially successful and one of the most influential entertainers of all time. His unique contributions to music, dance, and fashion,[1] along with a highly publicized personal life, made him a prominent figure in popular culture for over four decades.\n\nAlongside his brothers, he made his debut in 1964 as lead singer and youngest member of The Jackson 5, and later began a successful solo career in 1971. His 1982 album Thriller remains the best-selling album of all time, with Off the Wall (1979), Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991), and HIStory (1995) also among the world's best selling albums. He is widely credited with having transformed the music video from a promotional tool into an art form with videos for his songs such as &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, &quot;Beat It&quot; and &quot;Thriller&quot; making him the first African American artist to amass a strong crossover following on MTV. With stage performances and music videos, Jackson popularized a number of physically complicated dance techniques, such as the robot and the moonwalk. His distinctive musical sound, vocal style and choreography has inspired numerous pop, rock, R&amp;B and hip hop artists and is credited with breaking down cultural, racial, and generational barriers.\n\nOne of the few artists to have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice, his other achievements feature multiple Guinness World RecordsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½including the &quot;Most Successful Entertainer of All Time&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½15 Grammy Awards (including the &quot;Living Legend Award&quot; and the &quot;Lifetime Achievement Award&quot;), 26 American Music Awards (24 only as a solo artist, including one for &quot;Artist of the Century&quot;)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½more than any artistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½, 17 number one singles in the US (including the four as a member of the Jackson 5), and estimated sales between 350 million and 750 million records worldwide making him one of the best selling artists in history.[2] He was also a notable philanthropist and humanitarian who donated and raised over 300 million dollars through support of 39 charities and his own Heal the World Foundation.[3][4][5]\n\nJackson's personal relationships and life generated controversy for years. His changing appearance was noticed from the late 1970s onwards, with changes to his nose and to the color of his skin drawing media publicity. He was accused of child sexual abuse in 1993 though no charges were brought, and in 2005 he was tried and acquitted when the jury ruled him not guilty on all charges. He married twice, first in 1994 and again in 1996, and brought up three children, one born to a surrogate mother. While preparing for the This Is It concert tour in 2009, Jackson died at the age of 50 after suffering from cardiac arrest. He reportedly had been administered drugs such as propofol and lorazepam, and his death was ruled a homicide by the Los Angeles County coroner. His death triggered an outpouring of grief from around the world with his globally live broadcast memorial service attracting an audience of up to one billion people.[6]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46cc7dccada4d71dbf3662b312e23405b922e958","amp;dn":"Michael+Jackson+Tribute+Mega","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46cc7dccada4d71dbf3662b312e23405b922e958","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,204,125,204,173,164,215,29,191,54,98,179,18,226,52,5,185,34,233,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
