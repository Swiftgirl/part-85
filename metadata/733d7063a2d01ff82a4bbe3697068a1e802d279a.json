Sound does exist as electromagnetic vibrations. The specially designed instruments on board the various space probes used Plasma Wave antenna to record the vibrations used here, all within the range of human hearing (20-20,000 CPS)\n\nEach planet, moon and ring system has a distinctive &quot;musical&quot; pattern. Listening to this unusual recording has a mysteriously relaxing effect. After a long hard day, you can bring your brainwaves into a slower and meditative state.\n\nIn 1989, Dr. Jeffrey D. Thompson, D.C., B.F.A. was approached by representatives working with NASA and JPL to explore a series of powerful recordings which the Voyager I &amp; II Spacecraft had sent back from Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. These recordings seemed to be having a profound effect on the scientists and researchers who were exposed to them. Dr. Thompson was approached as an expert in the field of sound and healing, and especially in his work with &quot;Primordial Sounds.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Primordial sounds are human body sounds and nature sounds formatted in special ways to cause a deep response in the subconscious mind. These are extremely useful in all levels of healing. Could the space sounds actually be Primordial Sounds, also ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ from outer space but strangely familiar to us?\n\nRings of Uranus is the most amazing Space Sound CD. It resembles Gigantic Tibetan Bowls being played in space. This Audio Program from space is great for centering and balancing, creating a great meditation experience.\n\nVoyager II encountered the planet Uranus and discovered its Rings in January, 1986. One startling aspect of Uranus is that its axis of rotation is inclined 97Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â° 54 min from its orbital plane. Uranus lies on its side, with its rings vertical. Of the 9 rings of Uranus, six are inclined with respect to the planet's equatorial plane. The shape of several rings seem to pulsate slightly differently from the others: one &quot;breathes&quot; in and out, while another changes its eccentricity somewhat over time.\n\nVisual and radio observations revealed the nine classical Rings of Uranus to be composed mainly of meter-sized boulders and to contain scarcely any dust particles. The ring strands are among the darkest objects in the solar system. Such dark color may result from magnetosphereic bombardment of surfaces that contain organic molecules.\n\nAn extended corona of atomic and molecular hydrogen extends through the entire ring network of Uranus. Sunlight interactions with the corona cause it to radiate ultraviolet light - a phenomenon called &quot;electroglow&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:733d7063a2d01ff82a4bbe3697068a1e802d279a","amp;dn":"NASA+-+Voyager+Recording+-+Rings+of+Uranus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"733d7063a2d01ff82a4bbe3697068a1e802d279a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,61,112,99,162,208,31,248,42,75,190,54,151,6,138,30,128,45,39,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
