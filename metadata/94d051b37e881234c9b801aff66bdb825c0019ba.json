You use this and any other program you download from the\n    internet at your own risk. With that said, if you exercise caution (e.g. make sure VAC is not loaded),\n    you should be completely protected. Watch out for viruses when you look for third party hacks/cheats.\n\n    Do not exit VAC Chaos during a game... just don't, unless you want expensive paperweight.\n\n    If you are paranoid about a ban, rename your third party hacks/cheats before using.
