General admission was let in after all the kids were seated.  Video has some auto-focusing issues due to the stage lighting, but I did my best to adjust for this while taping.  Good closeups and steadily shot.  Excellent audio.  Vocals are strong and clear.\n\nENJOY!\n\nPlease do not reauthor this dvd.  \n\nDo NOT buy or sell this video.\n\n============================================\n\nVIDEO ATTRIBUTES:\nSource: Mini DV Master \nVideo compression mode : MPEG-2\nTV System: NTSC, 720x480\nAspect Ratio: 16:9\nSys Bitrate: 10080 kb/s VBR\n\nAUDIO ATTRIBUTES:\nSource: Camcorder Mic\nAudio Coding Mode: AC3\nSampling Rate: 48kz\nBitrate: 192 kb/s tot, stereo\n\n============================================\n\nSetlist:\n\n01.
