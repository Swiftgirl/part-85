It is an unavoidable by-product of going wireless. \n\n... \n\nAnother scientist, Dr Gerd Oberfeld, from Salzburg is now calling for Wi-Fi to be removed from schools.\n\nHe said: &quot;If you go into the data you can see a very very clear picture - it is like a puzzle and everything fits together from DNA break ups to the animal studies and up to the epidemiological evidence; that shows for example increased symptoms as well as increased cancer rates.\n\n...\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/panorama/6674675.stm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/panorama/6674675.stm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:806ec23df6ac60020b9c93f594e3193d34e7c657","amp;dn":"WIFI%3A+A+WARNING+SIGNAL+-+BBC+documentay","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"806ec23df6ac60020b9c93f594e3193d34e7c657","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,110,194,61,246,172,96,2,11,156,147,245,148,227,25,61,52,231,198,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
