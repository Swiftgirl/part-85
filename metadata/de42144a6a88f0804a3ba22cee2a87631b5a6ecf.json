Featuring the\nbest upfront house from Kandis worldwide underground, were taking you\nnow on a journey to a cyber-fuelled yet ancient and mystifying city that\nconstantly outdoes the imagination - the neon metropolis of Tokyo. Hed\nKandi DJs, Dean Rigg and Carl Hanaghan, lay down the mixes over 2 CDs,\neach selecting  tracks that define the mood and tone of our Tokyo parties\nat the renowned Warehouse702 club. We asked both DJs to discuss their\nmusic selection and heres what they had to say...\n\nCarl Hanaghan (CD2)  Working out my running order was a difficult\naffair with so many great records to choose from, however last years ADE\nConference saw one track in particular get its moment in the spotlight,\nthe Big Room Mix of Step By Step from the Dutch wizards Laidback Luke &amp;\nGregor Salto featuring a luscious top line from Mavis Acquah. Its been\na favourite in my CD wallet for some time now and truly sets the tone\nfor the mix to come. There has been a resurgence in remixing classic\nrecords of late and there is no better example than Harry Choo Choo\nRomeros, Night  The Black. Mr. Romero steps up to re-cut his greatest\npiece of work to date and gives it his trademark Bombossa stamp of\napproval. Towards the middle part of my mix a true Ibiza classic in\nthe making surfaces, La Mezcla from Switzerlands deep house producer\nMichel Cleis was named the undisputed track of Ibiza 2009, and the 2010\nremix from Ant Brooks is an essential DJ weapon Next up I thought I would\ntouch on my own production which is collaboration with My Digital Enemy,\nSubida (in Spanish means Rise) and we wanted to achieve the ultimate\nuplifting feel good moments for the dancefloor through this record. I\ntruly hope you enjoy it. Brighton-based Prok &amp; Fitch, two of the scenes\nhottest up and coming producers, wrap up my mix with their track Walk\nWith Me. It is simply infectious the charm is in the melody, and its\nthe perfect track to wrap up the compilation.\n\nFrom the land that brought you true Japanese icons such as Hello Kitty,\nPokmon and Nintendo (to name a few), we have decided to create an icon\nof our very own, World Series: Tokyo.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de42144a6a88f0804a3ba22cee2a87631b5a6ecf","amp;dn":"VA-Hed_Kandi_World_Series_Tokyo-2CD-2010-HNW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de42144a6a88f0804a3ba22cee2a87631b5a6ecf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,66,20,74,106,136,240,128,74,59,162,44,238,42,135,99,27,90,110,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
