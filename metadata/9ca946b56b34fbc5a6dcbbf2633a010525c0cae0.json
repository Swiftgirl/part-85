On 'Oh, How we Danced', 'Colleen' (penned by fellow unknown musician Lambert Mixson) and 'Jim's Song', singer Jacinta Whitcome, bassist Ian Jones and drummer Jonathan Bell are by Christopher Bell's side and it all sounds the best like this. Especially 'Jim's Song' which rises above the average banjo tune, thanks to the addition of Whitcome, whose vocals gives this melancholic song a classic country feel. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/about/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ca946b56b34fbc5a6dcbbf2633a010525c0cae0","amp;dn":"Christopher+Bell...I%5C%27ll+Be+Home%282007%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ca946b56b34fbc5a6dcbbf2633a010525c0cae0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,169,70,181,107,52,251,197,166,220,187,242,99,58,1,5,37,192,202,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
