After having single-handedly saved a remote planet from demonic threat, you return to Earth, only to find out that the demons have already invaded it, killed all its inhabitants or turned them into demons. It's your task to kill all the demons and to save the Earth.\n\n&quot;Doom II&quot; looks and plays very similarly to its predecessor, utilizing the same 3D graphical engine with 2D sprites for enemies. The gameplay once again consists entirely of navigating the hero from first-person view through 3D environments and shooting at the demons. You have the same weapons as in the first &quot;Doom&quot;, plus a new one. There are also some new demons in this sequel.\n\nUses Chocolate-Doom to play.
