Four years in the making, the series has been shot entirely in high definition.\n\nThe UK broadcast of Life consists of ten 50-minute episodes. The opening programme gives a general introduction to the series, a second looks at plants and the remainder are dedicated to the major animal groups. They aim to show common features that have contributed to the success of each group, and to document intimate and dramatic moments in the lives of selected species chosen for their charisma or their extraordinary behaviour. A ten-minute making-of feature Life on Location airs at the end of each episode, taking the total running time to 60 minutes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96e84683e6226499b717271f7ddf0b20e060b8d5","amp;dn":"BBC+life+2009+720p+x264+first+8+episodes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96e84683e6226499b717271f7ddf0b20e060b8d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,232,70,131,230,34,100,153,183,23,39,31,125,223,11,32,224,96,184,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
