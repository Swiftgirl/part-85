But for too long,\n      we seem to have forgotten that Earth is a blue planet, and that humans\n      need the global ocean more than it needs us.\n\n      In the first Suzuki Diaries, David and Sarika went on a European road\n      trip, meeting the leaders and innovators form Germany, Denmark, France\n      and Spain. This time, their adventure is much closer to home - exploring\n      the vast coastlines of Canada, meeting a few of its champions and bearing\n      witness to the beauty and incredible diversity of our coasts.\n\n      On this road trip, David and Sarika travel Canada's three coasts, meeting\n      scientists, fishers and the leaders who are trying to ensure the future\n      of the ocean.\n\n   _______________________________________________________________________________\n\n                                    Yours truly","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4e545f3f5e7dc2b161ebf31761037a3dcd6dd7e","amp;dn":"The.Nature.Of.Things-The_Suzuki_Diaries-Coastal_Canada.2009.HDTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4e545f3f5e7dc2b161ebf31761037a3dcd6dd7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,229,69,243,245,231,220,43,22,30,191,49,118,16,55,163,220,214,221,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
