We will be able to see and appreciate things that are normally beyond our senses because they take place much too quickly, or too slowly.\n\nYou know how your dog uses the language when drinking? What happens to a person in getting a fist fighter UFC? What happens when a spinning fan dropping an egg? Or shoot an apple?\nHowever, using only their eyes - can not see the details. In fact, in the world are countless number of events that we can not enjoy because of the limited capacity of our sensory organs ... but it was only until now.\nThe new show on Discovery Channel, in which Jeff Lieberman uses the latest technology in order to show the invisible before the wonderful things that in everyday life, we simply do not have time to notice.\nWith their equipment Time Warp team takes the simple events (a cat licking, opening bottles of champagne) - and not so simple (balloon with water in his face) - and turns them into a mixture of spectacular, surprising and informative.\n\nSpeed camera so even with the resolution of HDTV shoot different, usually very rapid and subtle eye processes, then all the show in slow motion. Classical prostrelivanie food, blows, piercing the air ball, throwing a ball filled with water, in the face, the various movements of the dog and others\n\n00: Pilot\n01: Stone Breaking\n02: Will it Bend\n03: Dry Ice Bomb\n04: Fuel Girls\n05: Taser\n06: Human Crash Test Dummy\n07: Samurai Sword Master\n08: Free Runner.BDrip\n09: Liquid Nitrogen\n10: Bull Whip\n11: Paintball\n12: Break-dancing\n13: Trail Bikes\n14: Cheerleading\n15: Sharpshooter\n16: Barefooter\n17: Stuntmen\n18: Body Modification\n19: Traps\n20: Lawn Tools\n\nQuality: BDrip\nFormat: MKV\nVideo codec: x264\nAudio codec: AAC, AC3\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 1280x720, 29.97fps ~ 4000kbps\nAudio1: English AAC 48000Hz 6ch 256kbps\nAudio2: Russian MPEG Audio Layer 3 48000Hz stereo 128 kbps\n\nHelp seeding, plz!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04f4f68ebb46edbb40cde70afd86dc2de5c7600f","amp;dn":"DSC+-+Time+Warp+Season+1+%5BBDRip+720p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04f4f68ebb46edbb40cde70afd86dc2de5c7600f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,244,246,142,187,70,237,187,64,205,231,10,253,134,220,45,229,199,96,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
