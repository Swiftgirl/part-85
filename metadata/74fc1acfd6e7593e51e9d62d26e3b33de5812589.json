ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlues ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ was recorded in England with Otis Spann on piano and vocals, Little Willie Smith on drums, Ransom Knowling on bass, and an uncredited Muddy Waters on guitar (Waters is simply listed as &quot;Brother&quot; in the liner notes), and was released in 1964. Aside from a couple harpsichord boogies, it was a solid set, with Spann shining on &quot;Sarah Street,&quot; &quot;The Blues Don't Like Nobody,&quot; the dramatic and moving &quot;Lost Sheep in the Fold,&quot; and the wonderful cover of Arthur Crudup's &quot;Rock Me Mama&quot; that opened the album. For some reason, however, producer Mike Vernon went back to the master tapes four years later and overdubbed horns and additional guitar on the tracks, then remixed, reshuffled, and renamed everything to make the album called Cracked Spanner Head, which was released in 1969.
