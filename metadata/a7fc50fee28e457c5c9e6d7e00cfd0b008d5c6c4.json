It follows the lives of plane crash survivors on a mysterious tropical island, after a commercial passenger jet flying between Sydney, Australia, and Los Angeles, United States, crashes somewhere in the South Pacific. Each episode typically features a primary storyline on the island as well as a secondary storyline from another point in a character's life, though other time-related plot devices change this formula in later episodes.\n\n\nPlot/Spoiler:\n\nABC once again invites new and avid Lost viewers to take another look at one of the most talked about and critically acclaimed shows. The special will take a look at the crash of Oceanic Flight 815, the mysteries of the island, its inhabitants, the Oceanic 6, the violent shifts through time on the island and the detonation of the hydrogen bomb. It will also delve into some of the questions that have been answered, and those that still remain a mystery.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7fc50fee28e457c5c9e6d7e00cfd0b008d5c6c4","amp;dn":"Lost.S06E00.The.Final.Chapter.720p.HDTV.x264-2HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7fc50fee28e457c5c9e6d7e00cfd0b008d5c6c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,252,80,254,226,142,69,124,92,158,109,126,0,207,208,176,8,213,198,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
