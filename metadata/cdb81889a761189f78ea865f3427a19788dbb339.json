Controlled and voiced by Edward, Dolenz produced the entire series and directed some of the early episodes. The show was set in the home of an ordinary British family, whose youngest child was a science boffin, who had created Metal Mickey to help around the home. The family consisted of a mother and father, three children and a grandmother. \n\nBritish comedy actress Irene Handl played the grandmother, whom Mickey affectionately called &quot;my little fruitbat&quot;. \n\nMetal Mickey's catchphrase was &quot;boogie, boogie, boogie&quot;, and his favourite treat was Atomic Thunderbusters (which had the appearance of lemon bonbons).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdb81889a761189f78ea865f3427a19788dbb339","amp;dn":"Metal+Mickey+Series+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdb81889a761189f78ea865f3427a19788dbb339","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,184,24,137,167,97,24,159,120,234,134,95,52,39,161,151,136,219,179,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
