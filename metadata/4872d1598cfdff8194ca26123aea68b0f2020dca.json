The year is 1969. An ancient     \n          curse has spilled over into the world of the ordinary     \n          living, with werewolves, vampires, and zombies shedding   \n          bucketloads of blood. In short, Tristan (our vampire) is  \n          not a bad guy despite his undead status, and he was in    \n          love with a girl named Lucy. Tristan's former wife, the   \n          daughter of the Devil, doesn't take the news of Tristan's \n          love affair with Lucy very well, and she curses Lucy to   \n          become a ravenous werewolf roaming the Earth for all      \n          eternity...that is, unless a silver bullet pierces her    \n          heart and kills her. Lucy's death brings the daughter of  \n          the Devil back from Hell. She returns not just for revenge\n          but to find a talisman, which, together with a book bound \n          in human flesh and inked in blood (yes, a bit like Evil   \n          Dead in that regard, I know) that, if finished by the hand\n          of an unwilling virgin, will unleash Hell on Earth. So, it\n          is up to a hippie chick, Sadie Hawkins, and a comic       \n          book reading soda Jerk, Darrel Lee, to save the world, but\n          not without alittle help from a group of indie film reject\n          shooting a zombie flick in a town called Desolation.      \n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n                                                                  \n                                                                   \n                                                                   \n                                                                   \n             _______  ____________________________________        \n                   |    /   _        ___/  __       _(        \n                      |    |   |     |       __|__            \n                    |   /|   |     |      |  |        |      \n                _________|_____________/________/       \n                                                                  \n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n                 Source dupe pattern resulted in a fps at 23.661    \n                             vob samples included                   \n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n           _________ ____________________________________________   \n                 _     _        _        _      ___       /   \n            |    !
