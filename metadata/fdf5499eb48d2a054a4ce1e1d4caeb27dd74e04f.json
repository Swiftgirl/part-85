In India he witnesses a total solar    \n    eclipse - when the link to the light and heat that       \n    sustains us is cut off for a few precious minutes.        \n                                                               \n    But heat and light are not the only power of the sun      \n    over the solar system. In Norway, Brian watches the      \n    battle between the sun's wind and earth, as the night     \n    sky glows with the northern lights.                        \n                                                              \n    Beyond earth, the solar wind continues, creating         \n    dazzling aurora on other planets. Brian makes contact     \n    with Voyager, a probe that has been travelling since       \n    its launch 30 years ago. Now 14 billion kilometres away   \n    Voyager has just detected the solar wind is beginning    \n    to peter out. But even here we haven't reached the end    \n    of the sun's rule.                                         \n                                                              \n    Brian explains how its greatest power, gravity, reaches  \n    out for hundreds of billions of kilometres, where the     \n    lightest gravitational touch encircles our solar system    \n    in a mysterious cloud of comets.                          \n                                                                \n      \n\n      \n            .  . ..: RiPPER/RELEASE NOTES :.. .  .           \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n      \n\n                                             \n                  ..: GROUP NEWS/CONTACT :..  \n                                                           \n                                                      \n       SFM is dedicated to bringing you high quality     \n      TVRips and DVDRips of popular series and movies for   \n                     your viewing pleasure!                 \n                                                           \n       We are currently looking for:                       \n       - 100+ Mbit EU dump site for exclusive SFM usage   \n       - HDTV/PDTV cappers                                \n       - Crates &amp; Kegs of Beer (full of course)          \n                                                         \n                  .  . ..: GREETZ :.. .  .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdf5499eb48d2a054a4ce1e1d4caeb27dd74e04f","amp;dn":"Wonders.Of.The.Solar.System.S01E01.720p.HDTV.x264-SFM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdf5499eb48d2a054a4ce1e1d4caeb27dd74e04f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,245,73,158,180,141,42,5,74,76,225,225,212,202,235,39,221,116,224,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
