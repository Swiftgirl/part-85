Ripped and cracked by RELOADED.\n\nGame is working but you can't save until Level 2 check point.\n\nRed Faction: Guerrilla takes place in the year 2120. The Earth Defense Force (EDF), the allies in the original &quot;Red Faction&quot;, have become the main antagonist of Guerrilla. Although initially supportive of the Martian miners, Earth's natural resources have run scarce, and as a result, its world economy has collapsed from rampant speculation of commodities and lack of production. Under pressure by Earth's corporations and leaders to acquire the resources of Mars at any cost and at a pace to meet Earth's high demand, the EDF has forced Martian society into a permanent state of unfree labour. The newly-reformed &quot;Red Faction&quot; arises to rebel against the EDF, drive them off the planet, and begin fairer negotiations with Earth.\n\n\nRequirements\n- OS : Windows XP / Vista\n- CPU : 2.0 GHz Dual-Core Processor (Intel Core 2 Duo or AMD Athlon X2)\n- Memory : 1 GB RAM / 15 GB of Hard Drive space\n- Video Card : 128 MB 3D Video Card w/Shader Model 3.0 Support (Nvidia GeForce 7600/ATI Radeon X1300)\n\nI'll seed for a few days but that's all","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f4749a056e26897be043ba86adc329a13e93094","amp;dn":"Red+Faction%3A+Guerrilla+%28Full+Game+%2B+Crack%29+%5BPC+Version%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f4749a056e26897be043ba86adc329a13e93094","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,71,73,160,86,226,104,151,190,4,59,168,106,220,50,154,19,233,48,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
