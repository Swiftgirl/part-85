It is against the backdrop of this coming chaos that Ares, \n  an orphan from a forgotten village, sets out to seek his fortune as an \n  adventurer. At the start of his journey, he encounters a girl with \n  mysterious powers named Sierra. Together, they embark on an adventure \n  that will ultimately decide the fate of the entire world.\n  \n  Ragnarok Online DS brings the same addictive gameplay of customization \n  and exploration to the Nintendo DS platform. Players upgrade their \n  character's armor and weapons by either taking them to a blacksmith to \n  be refined, or by affixing effect cards dropped by defeated monsters. \n  In addition to having their characters' base levels increase, each \n  character earns both Status and Skill Points each time they gain a \n  level. Staying true to the community and teamwork that the original is \n  based on, Ragnarok Online DS allows players to team up with two other \n  friends wirelessly to take on the Tower of Mirages, which has more than \n  50 floors, randomly generated maps and completion conditions, and the \n  chance to obtain rare items.\n\n\n -- Greetings --------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n \n  Capital.
