ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Germanic TribesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ portrays the protagonist of an epoch of formative influence for Europe ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ whose legacy is still with us. Due to new methods and discoveries, research is now able to present a different picture of the Germanic tribes. Many cliches about the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbarbariansÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of the North have to be discarded as myths!\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThrough its forests terrible, through its marshes horribleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, thus characterizes the Roman historian Tacitus ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGermaniaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, the area incognita beyond the Rhine. The natives there, the Germanic Tribes, were not in fact primeval barbarians, nor were they heroic Wagnerian figures, and they were certainly not the progenitors of a racist weltanschauung.\n\nHow they actually did live, what Gods they worshipped, their combative and collaborative relationship with Rome, what they wrote in their runes and how they became Christians are all topics explored in the Gruppe 5 production ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Germanic Tribes. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gruppe5film.de/g5/en/history/the_germanic_tribes.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gruppe5film.de/g5/en/history/the_germanic_tribes.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n  ____                      _                      _   _       _\n / ___|___  _ __  ___ _ __ (_)_ __ __ _  ___ _   _| | | |_   _| |__\n| |   / _ \\| '_ \\/ __| '_ \\| | '__/ _` |/ __| | | | |_| | | | | '_ \\\n| |__| (_) | | | \\__ \\ |_) | | | | (_| | (__| |_| |  _  | |_| | |_) |\n \\____\\___/|_| |_|___/ .__/|_|_|  \\__,_|\\___|\\__, |_| |_|\\__,_|_.__/\n                     |_|                     |___/\n   ____\n  / ___|___  _ __ ___\n | |   / _ \\| '_ ` _ \\\n | |__| (_) | | | | | |\n(_)____\\___/|_| |_| |_|\n\n\nPLEASE KEEP SEEDED TO PASS ON THE MESSAGE.
