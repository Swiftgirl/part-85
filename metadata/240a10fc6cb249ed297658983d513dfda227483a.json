Faithful to the setting and period of the beloved novel and filmed entirely on location in the U.K, this is the first movie version of the story in 65 years. The classic tale of love and misunderstanding unfolds in class-conscious England near the close of the 18th century. The five Bennet sisters ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Elizabeth, or Lizzie (Keira Knightley), Jane (Rosamund Pike), Lydia (Jena Malone), Mary (Talulah Riley), and Kitty (Carey Mulligan) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ have been raised well aware of their motherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s (two-time Academy Award nominee Brenda Blethyn) fixation on finding them husbands and securing set futures. The spirited and intelligent Elizabeth, however, strives to live her life with a broader perspective, as encouraged by her doting father (two-time Golden Globe Award winner Donald Sutherland). When wealthy bachelor Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods) takes up residence in a nearby mansion, the Bennets are abuzz. Amongst the manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sophisticated circle of London friends and the influx of young militia officers, surely there will be no shortage of suitors for the Bennet sisters. Eldest daughter Jane, serene and beautiful, seems poised to win Mr. BingleyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s heart. For her part, Lizzie meets with the handsome and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ it would seem ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ snobbish Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen), and the battle of the sexes is joined. Their encounters are frequent and spirited yet far from encouraging. Lizzie finds herself even less inclined to accept a marriage proposal from a distant cousin, Mr. Collins (Tom Hollander), and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ supported by her father ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ stuns her mother and Mr. Collins by declining. When the heretofore good-natured Mr. Bingley abruptly departs for London, devastating Jane, Lizzie holds Mr. Darcy culpable for contributing to the heartbreak. But a crisis involving youngest sister Lydia soon opens LizzieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s eyes to the true nature of her relationship with Mr. Darcy. The ensuing rush of feelings leaves no one unchanged, and inspires the Bennets and everyone around them to reaffirm what is most important in life. \n\nCast\nKeira Knightley, Matthew Macfadyen, Brenda Blethyn, Donald Sutherland, Tom Hollander, Rosamund Pike, Jena Malone, and Judi Dench.\n\nCasting by Jina Jay. \nMusic Supervisor, Nick Angel. \nMusic by Dario Marianelli. \nHair and Make-Up Designer, Fae Hammond. \nCostume Designer, Jacqueline Durran. \nEditor, Paul Tothill. \nProduction Designer, Sarah Greenwood. \nDirector of Photography, Roman Osin. \nCo-Producer, Jane Frazer. \nExecutive Producers, Debra Hayward, Liza Chasin. \nBased on the novel by Jane Austen. \nScreenplay by Deborah Moggach. \nProduced by Tim Bevan, Eric Fellner, Paul Webster. \nDirected by Joe Wright.
