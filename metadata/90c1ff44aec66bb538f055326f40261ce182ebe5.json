Windows, by design,                \n             allows programs to monopolize your CPU without                   \n             restraint -- leading to freezes and hangs. Process               \n             Lasso's ProBalance (Process Balance) technology                  \n             intelligently adjusts the priority of running                    \n             programs so that badly behaved or overly active                  \n             processes won't interfere with your ability to use               \n             the computer!                                                    \n                                                                              \n             Process Lasso also offers an assortment of ways to               \n             take full control of how your CPUs are allocated to              \n             running programs.
