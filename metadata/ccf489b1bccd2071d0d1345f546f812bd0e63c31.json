In need of money, they accept Wirth into their home. Wirth's grand occult project seals the Wollners off from the rest of the world and makes them players in a horrifying game of survival. After 71 years, in 2007, Evan Marshall's life has stalled at twenty-five years old. Left without answers after his older brother Victor's disappearance from a camping trip near Town Creek, he has tried to move on. But when Victor returns one night, very much alive and having escaped his captors, Evan asks no questions - at his brother's request, he loads their rifles, packs up their boat and follows him back to Town Creek on a mission of revenge that will test them in every possible way.\n\n----\n\nAll EcKstasyMEDIA torrents can be downloaded from http://torrentbucket.org/\nFeel free to join us on TorrentBucket for chats and torrent requests. \n\nFor your own security, be aware of fake torrents uploaded by imitators.\nPlease seed once your download has completed. --EcKstasy\n\nHow to find me:\nE-mail: eckstasy[at]ymail.com\nIRC: irc.torrentbucket.org #TorrentBucket\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccf489b1bccd2071d0d1345f546f812bd0e63c31","amp;dn":"Town+Creek+%282009%29+%5BXviD-DVDRIP%5D-EcKstasyMEDIA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccf489b1bccd2071d0d1345f546f812bd0e63c31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,244,137,177,188,205,32,113,208,209,52,95,84,111,129,43,208,230,60,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
