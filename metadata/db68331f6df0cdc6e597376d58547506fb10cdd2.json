They now have a cellist. Much of the cello playing isn't integral to the structure of the tunes, yet when it is audible, it seems to go along with the music very well. Another point of note is that this release doesn't seem to have quite the heaviness that Domestica had, nor does it have the dynamics that Storms of Early Summer or their split with Silver Scooter showcased. So, what is Burst and Bloom like exactly? Well, it seems to be a little more technical -- more intricate guitar work, layered nicely with the cello in some cases. A little speedier with the tempo and much steadier in their delivery. None of this is to say that Cursive wasn't those things in previous efforts, it's just that's what sticks out the most. Burst and Bloom is another lyrical catharsis for Tim Kasher, a delivery of his melancholy, yet not in such a pungent manner. The emotional dishevelment is more subtler and perhaps only longtime fans will grasp the difference. New fans will appreciate a concise yet wonderful introduction to this Omaha, NE, five-piece.\n\nAudio CD\nReleased 2001\nLabel: Saddle Creek\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Indie Rock\nQuality: FLAC\nAllmusic rating:3/5 stars\n\nTracks:\n\n\n   1. &quot;Sink To The Beat&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:13\n   2. &quot;The Great Decay&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:17\n   3. &quot;Tall Tales, Telltales&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:08\n   4. &quot;Mothership, Mothership, Do You Read Me?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:18\n   5. &quot;Fairytales Tell Tales&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:02\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db68331f6df0cdc6e597376d58547506fb10cdd2","amp;dn":"Cursive+-+Burst+and+Bloom+EP+%282001%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db68331f6df0cdc6e597376d58547506fb10cdd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,104,51,31,109,240,205,198,229,151,55,109,88,84,117,6,251,16,205,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
