Reunited with his estranged father, Talbot sets out to \n find his brother... and discovers a horrifying destiny for himself. Talbot's \n childhood ended the night his mother died. After he left the sleepy Victorian\n hamlet of Blackmoor, he spent decades recovering and trying to forget. But when\n his brother's fiance, Gwen Conliffe, tracks him down to help find her missing\n love, Talbot returns home to join the search. He learns that something with brute\n strength and insatiable bloodlust has been killing the villagers, and that a \n suspicious Scotland Yard inspector named Aberline has come to investigate.\n             \n             iMDB .........: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0780653/\n\n  We don't normally do low quality releases, but here is a ts with line audio!\n\n  .:.........................................................................:.\n\n   MOViERUSH is a group dedicted to bring you the classics from UK and USA!\n   because most of the releases we do are internal, we try and keep to the best\n   standards possible! we are a group of people who love to watch movies, so we \n   release films that everyone else will enjoy! -o\n\n  .:.........................................................................:.\n\n    We are looking for any of the following:\n\n    100mbit+ affils in europe only!\n    Experienced XviD encoders and audio syncers.\n    If you can supply Pre-Retail DVDs, R5, Silvers or anything else we might need!\n\n    EMAiL: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;86ebe9f0efe3f4f3f5eec6eef3f5eea8e5e9eb&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n  .:............................M.O.V.i.E.R.U.S.H............................:.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:469c38144a8248e02d19ec0f791a3cf8dffc00a3","amp;dn":"The.Wolfman.TELESYNC.XviD-MOViERUSH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"469c38144a8248e02d19ec0f791a3cf8dffc00a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,156,56,20,74,130,72,224,45,25,236,15,121,26,60,248,223,252,0,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
