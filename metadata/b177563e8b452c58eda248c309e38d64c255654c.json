Shot on 16mm film (so don't expect HD) for budget reasons and featuring actors that would later go on to get very famous for on reason or another.\n\nPlot:\n\nDeep space scout ship DarkStar has been sent out to prepare the galaxy for colonisation. It's job is to explode unstable planets using thermostellar smart bombs (which are perhaps smarter than the crew are).  Unfortunatly, due to the fact that they have now been in space for thirty years, things are starting to malfunction on the ship and the crew has fallen into such an apathetic state that no one seems to care enough to do anything about it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b177563e8b452c58eda248c309e38d64c255654c","amp;dn":"DarkStar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b177563e8b452c58eda248c309e38d64c255654c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,119,86,62,139,69,44,88,237,162,72,195,9,227,141,100,194,85,101,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
