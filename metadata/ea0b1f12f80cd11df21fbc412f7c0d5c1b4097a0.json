But if my memory serves correctly, none of them ever managed to do what Microsoft did today: shut the site down.\n\nNetwork Solutions shut off the lights in response to a DMCA notice, after Cryptome published a 22-page Microsoft document outlining how the company stores private user data in its web-connected servers.
