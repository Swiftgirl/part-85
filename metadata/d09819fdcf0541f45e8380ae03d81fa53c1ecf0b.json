She's loquacious to a fault. When kids at a career day make fun of her for being single, she accepts a blind date with Steve, the cameraman for a CNN-like news network. Within minutes she decides he's the man for her. He's quickly put off by her constant verbiage and over-the-top advances; he makes an off-hand remark about going on the road with her, and splits. She's moonstruck, writes a sappy crossword puzzle, loses her job, and decides to follow him as the news team crisscrosses the Southwest; Steve's team eggs her on. Then she falls in a mine shaft, and she and Steve become a story; is it a love story?\n\n\n\n\nENGLISH AUDIO WITH PORTUGUESE SUBTITLES THAT YOU CAN CHOOSE TO USE OR NOT USE DURING PLAY BACK OF VIDEO.\n\n\nAUDIO EM INGLÃƒÆ’Ã…Â S COM LEGENDAS EM PORTUGUÃƒÆ’Ã…Â S QUE VOCE PODE ESCOLHER USAR OU NAO USAR.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0881891/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0881891/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d09819fdcf0541f45e8380ae03d81fa53c1ecf0b","amp;dn":"All.About.Steve.%28.Maluca.Paixao.%29.%5BON%2FOFF%5D.Portuguese.Subtitles.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d09819fdcf0541f45e8380ae03d81fa53c1ecf0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,152,25,253,207,5,65,244,94,131,128,174,3,216,31,165,60,30,207,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
