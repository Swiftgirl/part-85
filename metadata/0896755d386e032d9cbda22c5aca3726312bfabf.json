Using the loud-soft dynamics of emo and the catchy playfulness of indie pop proves to be a delicious combination, and Rainer Maria pull it off with grace and intelligence. Sometimes sentimental, but never too sappy, Look Now Look Again showcases the band's strongest attributes: boy-girl vocal dueling, stripped down production to reveal the core emotion of a song, and the melodic and furious attack of a band in its prime. Guitar, bass, and drums tastefully play cat and mouse, weaving in and out of each other, laying a solid foundation for Caithlin De Marrais' poetic lyrics. Her verbal gymnastics are a pleasure to listen to, lyrics like &quot;Like foreign post/I leave twice a day, but take a week to get there&quot; or &quot;I'm certain if I drive into those trees/It would make less of a mess/Than you've made of me&quot; are examples of her subtle wit. Although they probably will not be the messiahs of a dying genre, Rainer Maria will be a band whose creative future is beyond promising; Look Now Look Again is their proof. \n\nFormat: CD\nReleased: 1999\nLabel: Polyvinyl\nGenre: Pop/Rock\nStyle: Indie Pop, Indie Rock\nQuality: FLAC\nAllmusic Rating 4 / 5 stars\n\nTracks:\n\n   1. &quot;Rise&quot;                            4:18\n   2. &quot;Planetary&quot;                       5:21\n   3. &quot;Broken Radio&quot;                    3:11\n   4. &quot;Feeling Neglected&quot;               4:43\n   5. &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot;          3:37\n   6. &quot;The Reason The Night Is Long&quot;    3:48\n   7. &quot;Lost, Dropped and Cancelled&quot;     2:45\n   8. &quot;Centrifuge&quot;                      3:37\n   9. &quot;I'm Melting!&quot;                    3:14","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0896755d386e032d9cbda22c5aca3726312bfabf","amp;dn":"Rainer+Maria+-+Look+Now%2C+Look+Again+%281999%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0896755d386e032d9cbda22c5aca3726312bfabf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,150,117,93,56,110,3,45,156,189,162,44,90,202,55,38,49,43,250,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
