As a duel approaches, Chinese champion Ching Wan (Damian Lau) and Japanese champion Hashimoto (Norman Chu) uncover a plot to rig the fight.\n\nChing Wan, known as &quot;Lord of the Sword&quot;, is a peaceful and contemplative martial artist who has trained with Shaolin monks as well as a mischievous hermit. By contrast, Hashimoto is a pitiless and honorable samurai who kills his sensei as his final lesson before leaving for the duel. Meanwhile, ninjas led by a Japanese official collude with the Chinese wardens of the duel to kidnap famous fighters and sabotage the duel for Hashimoto. The honorable samurai, however, does not go along with the plan.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1705bfdc3a423f57905d93b8e16d08888d711d31","amp;dn":"Duel+2+the+death","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1705bfdc3a423f57905d93b8e16d08888d711d31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,5,191,220,58,66,63,87,144,93,147,184,225,109,8,136,141,113,29,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
