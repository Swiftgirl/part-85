It is the lead single from her second studio album, The Fame Monster. The track was produced by RedOne and was inspired by the paranoia that she had felt while touring through the previous year. After the demo version of the song leaked, Gaga premiered the song at Alexander McQueen's Spring/Summer 2010 Paris Fashion Week show on October 6, 2009, followed by the release of the cover art. Composed in a similar tempo to her previous singles, &quot;Bad Romance&quot; features a bridge and a full-throated chorus. The song talks about exploring the joys of a bad romance while referencing Alfred Hitchcock films in some of the verses.\n\n    It was performed on The Jay Leno Show where Gaga wore a pair of black sunglasses and a black jacket with shoulder pads that extended above her head. Her male backup dancers were dressed in black suits and S&amp;M headgear. They eventually removed her jacket to reveal a low-cut tank top.\n\n\n                                       Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e01e7bba35cc1802e0b38c55613990c089710331","amp;dn":"Lady+Gaga+-+Bad+Romance%28Live+Show%29-Wushan.AVI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e01e7bba35cc1802e0b38c55613990c089710331","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,30,123,186,53,204,24,2,224,179,140,85,97,57,144,192,137,113,3,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
