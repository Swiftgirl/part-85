But this time the culprit is much bigger than \nGeneral Motors, and the crime scene far wider than Flint, Michigan. From \nMiddle America, to the halls of power in Washington, to the global \nfinancial epicenter in Manhattan, Michael Moore will once again take film \ngoers into uncharted territory. With both humor and outrage, Michael Moore's \nCapitalism: A Love Story explores a taboo question: What is the price that \nAmerica pays for its love of capitalism? Years ago, that love seemed so \ninnocent. Today, however, the American dream is looking more like a \nnightmare as families pay the price with their jobs, their homes and their \nsavings. Moore takes us into the homes of ordinary people whose lives have \nbeen turned upside down; and he goes looking for explanations in Washington, \nDC and elsewhere. What he finds are the all-too-familiar symptoms of a love \naffair gone astray: lies, abuse, betrayal...and 14,000 jobs being lost \nevery day. Capitalism: A Love Story is both a culmination of Moore's \nprevious works and a look into what a more hopeful future could look like. \nIt is Michael Moore's ultimate quest to answer the question he's posed \nthroughout his illustrious filmmaking career: Who are we and why do we \nbehave the way that we do?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f38595de8a8c0f595bc9de08350aa8782e85199","amp;dn":"Capitalism.A.Love.Story.2009.DOCU.DVDR-Counterfeit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f38595de8a8c0f595bc9de08350aa8782e85199","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,56,89,93,232,168,192,245,149,188,157,224,131,80,170,135,130,232,81,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
