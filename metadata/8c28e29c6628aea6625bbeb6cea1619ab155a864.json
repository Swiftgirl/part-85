This is what I use.\nVLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.\nOne can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.\nQuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.\nMany of movies I encode have embedded subtitles. So far, only VLC player is able to use them correctly.\n\nGenre:Adventure | Drama | Family | Fantasy\nIMDB rating: 7,9/10\nDirected by: Spike Jonze\nStarring (Voices): Mark Ruffalo, James Gandolfini, Forest Whitaker\n\nInput: Where.The.Wild.Things.Are.DVDSCR.XviD-NEPTUNE\n\nPlot: Max is a young boy who feels misunderstood and wants to have fun all the time.
