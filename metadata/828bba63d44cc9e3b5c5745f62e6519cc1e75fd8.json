Burdened by grief, he goes to live with his Uncle Leonard, an ex SAS officer, who runs a below-ground storage facility in the city. While exploring the maze of corridors Jimmy comes across a deeply disturbed man, Francis, who seems to be hiding evidence of a crime in his storage unit inside a red metal drum barrel. Jimmy breaks into this man's room and discovers clear evidence of a murder. He shows his uncle and the two men, not trusting the police, decide to break into the man's house and confront him. Jimmy soon discovers that once you start down a dark road, it's impossible to turn back.\n\nRESOLUTION........: 624x352\nVIDEO.............: 955kb/s @ 25fps\nAUDIO FORMAT......: MP3 @ 128Kb/s\nLANGUAGES.........: English\n\ncredit AVCDVD &amp; to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone\n\nUPLOAD DEDICATED TO redchaos2354, Motley Crue, jdpennington, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady &amp; many, many more &amp; to all the awesome people who are sharing (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY)***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE!!!\n\n*****help what we can with haiti or any other in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:828bba63d44cc9e3b5c5745f62e6519cc1e75fd8","amp;dn":"Storage.2009.DVDRip.XviD-AVCDVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"828bba63d44cc9e3b5c5745f62e6519cc1e75fd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,139,186,99,212,76,201,227,181,197,116,95,98,230,81,156,193,231,95,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
