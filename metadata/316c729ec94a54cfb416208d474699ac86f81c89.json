If you made it there, you had it made because for the first time, the entire county was at home watching. During the course of the show's run, many of the early rock and roll legends were featured in career-defining performances. These cultural milestones have been compiled for Ed Sullivan's Rock 'n' Roll Classics, along with archival footage and narration for insight on the artists, their eras, and their classic appearances. Now seen with half a century of hindsight, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s clear Ed Sullivan was right--his was a really big show. \n\n\n-Chart Toppers Volume 2: Top Hits of 1968 Chart Toppers Volume 1: Top Hits of 1965  (Beach Boys, Chambers Brothers, Gary Puckett and the Union Gap, Spanky and Our Gang, Tommy James and the Shondells), Top Hits of 1969 (Brooklyn Bridge, Smith, CCR, Oliver, The 5th Dimension), Top Hits of 1970 (Jackson 5, The Supremes, Carpenters, BJ Thomas, 5th Dimension) \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:316c729ec94a54cfb416208d474699ac86f81c89","amp;dn":"Ed+Sullivan%5C%27s+Rock%5C%27n%5C%27Roll+Classics+-2+AVI+VIDEO+Rel+by+RISSL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"316c729ec94a54cfb416208d474699ac86f81c89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,108,114,158,201,74,84,207,180,22,32,141,71,70,153,172,134,248,28,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
