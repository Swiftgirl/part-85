Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez star as Alice and Rain, two members of a commando team assigned to infiltrate the Hive, an underground research laboratory owned by the faceless conglomerate known as the Umbrella Corporation. A bio-engineered virus has been released into the maze-like Hive, turning the facility's employees into mindless, flesh-eating zombies. A single scratch or bite from one of these rampaging ghouls dooms its victim, so the commandos have their work cut out for them as they attempt to reach the Red Queen, the lab's supercomputer -- and their sole hope of halting the spread of the contagion. Before they can complete their mission, however, the soldiers must overcome a variety of deadly obstacles, including mutant dogs, lasers, and a genetically altered beast known as The Licker, whose strength increases with every victim it slays. Alice and Rain also discover that the release of the virus may not have been an accident, and that a cure may exist somewhere in the deadly Hive. Resident Evil co-stars Eric Mabius, James Purefoy, Martin Crewes, and Colin Salmon\n\n\n                                Mpaa Rating++++++++++\n\n                         Rated R for strong sci-fi/horror violence, language and sexuality/nudity.\n\n\n                                Retail Release Date++++++++\n\n                        15 March 2002\n\n                                DVD Content++++++++++\n\n                             \n                 Main Movie+++++++++++++++\n\t              +Video- CCE Encoded - 5 passes\n\t              +Audio-English, French, Spanish, Portugese\n                          +Subs-English, French, Spanish, Portugese\n\n\n                 Menu+++++++\n\t              +Yes\t\n              \n                 Extras/Special Features+++++\n\t              +Yes\n\n                 Removed++++++++++++++\n\t              FBI crap and trailers and all of the other annoying and useless stuff.\n\n\n\n                 Chapters++++++++++++++\n\n1.
