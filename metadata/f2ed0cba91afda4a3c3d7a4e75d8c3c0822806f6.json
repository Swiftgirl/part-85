This turned out to be a documentary of how a group of musicians was affected by this infamous date in time.\n======================================================================\n\nBackground\n\nAs Sting wanted to put together a concert in his home, he enlisted a group of musicians to practice and perform this concert with him. The events leading up to the night of the performance were filmed and within these events on the day of the performance, the New York terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 occurred and the group was made aware of this. Due to the tragedy, Sting offered the musicians an opportunity to step down from the concert. None did, and they all performed the concert as originally intended although Sting indicates on the DVD documentary that the tone of the evening was different from how it was originally intended.\n\nAs a result of the tragic circumstances, the concert was dedicated to those who lost their lives that day.\n\nDVD Track Listing\n\n   1. &quot;Fragile&quot;\n   2. &quot;A Thousand Years&quot;\n   3. &quot;Perfect Love...Gone Wrong&quot;\n   4. &quot;All This Time&quot;\n   5. &quot;Seven Days&quot;\n   6. &quot;The Hounds of Winter&quot;\n   7. &quot;Don't Stand So Close to Me&quot;\n   8. &quot;When We Dance&quot;\n   9. &quot;Dienda&quot;\n  10. &quot;Roxanne&quot;\n  11. &quot;If You Love Somebody Set Them Free&quot;\n  12. &quot;Brand New Day&quot;\n  13. &quot;Fields of Gold&quot;\n  14. &quot;Moon Over Bourbon Street&quot;\n  15. &quot;Shape of My Heart&quot;\n  16. &quot;If I Ever Lose My Faith In You&quot;\n  17. &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2ed0cba91afda4a3c3d7a4e75d8c3c0822806f6","amp;dn":"All+This+Time+Video+Xvid+-+Sting+2001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2ed0cba91afda4a3c3d7a4e75d8c3c0822806f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,237,12,186,145,175,218,74,60,61,122,78,117,216,195,192,130,40,6,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
