The title refers to the tower of Babel in the Bible.  The story starts in Marokko with two boys that just for the fun of it shoot a gun.  This causes a chain reaction that change the lives of people on three coninents forever.  Fantastic acting by Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett and Gael Garcia Bernal.  2hrs and 9 minutes.\n\nPLEASE SEED!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cafe6714a42bf45a8305e0251500cbd47b18c52","amp;dn":"Babel+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cafe6714a42bf45a8305e0251500cbd47b18c52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,175,230,113,74,66,191,69,168,48,94,2,81,80,12,189,71,177,140,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
