Featured in the documentary &quot;Horror Business&quot;. Twisted twilight zone style is two films in one: RITES OF THE ILLUMINATI about reptilian politicians engaging in rituals, blackmail and flesh eating. ULTRA - about the horrors of the CIA's MK-Ultra project. Mind control, president bashing, extreme satire, cannibalism reptilian-satanic ritual, forced piss drinking, humiliation - Powell, Bush, Cheney are all here to amuse, hunt humans and much more off the wall craziness. This film was due to be released on DVD in the states early last year but never came. I got this from a friend and it's the only way to see this lunatic flick right now.\n\n\n\nNote: the previous torrent had audio sync problems, this one is on target.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:089c0d78ad8467352f020848106bcc056a963f03","amp;dn":"The+Sins+of+Government+-+2004+UNCUT+%28proper+audio+sync%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"089c0d78ad8467352f020848106bcc056a963f03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,156,13,120,173,132,103,53,47,2,8,72,16,107,204,5,106,150,63,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
