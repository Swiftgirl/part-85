Lucy (Missi           \n           Pyle) has always been obese, and now that her health has       \n           taken a turn for the worse, she wants to spend her last        \n           days with the estranged college social group who helped        \n           her through one of the most difficult periods of her           \n           entire life. Upon learning that Lucy is on her deathbed,       \n           her loyal friends all rush to Montana in order to be by        \n           her side for one last weekend together. Immediately upon       \n           arriving, however, it's glaringly obvious to all of            \n           Lucy's friends that something isn't right. Her condition       \n           is a far cry from what she made it out to be in her            \n           desperate messages, and as tensions begin to rise Lucy         \n           realizes that the people standing before her today simply      \n           aren't the same people whom she remembered so fondly from      \n           college. With no modern conveniences to fall back on as        \n           the reunited group begins an arduous four-day hike into        \n           the wilderness, everyone's deepest fears and demons            \n           gradually claw their way to the surface, leaving Lucy to       \n           wonder whether her &quot;final wish&quot; was truly the brilliant        \n           idea she initially thought it to be.                           \n                                                                          \n                                                    \n                        \n                            \n                                 \n                                                                          \n           Missi Pyle................. : .......................Lucy      \n           Melissa McCarthy........... : ......................Becky      \n           Josh Hopkins............... : .....................George      \n           Octavia Spencer............ : .......................Mary      \n           Jack Noseworthy............ : .....................Trevor      \n           Larry Sullivan............. : .....................Austin      \n           Phill Lewis................ : .......................Raye      \n           Philip Littell............. : ....................Richard      \n           Allison Janney............. : ....................Suzanna      \n           William Sanderson.......... : ........................Sam      \n           Allison Mackie............. : ........Flight Attendant #1      \n           Anna Maria Horsford........ : ..............Raye's Mother      \n           Jeannetta Arnette.......... : ...................Waitress      \n           Drew Matthews.............. : .................Young Raye      \n           Amy Landers................ : ....Strict Flight Attendant      \n                                                                          \n                                                                      \n                      \n                             \n                       \n         \n                                                                        \n                                                                            \n                    Thanks our friends at KART3LDVD.
