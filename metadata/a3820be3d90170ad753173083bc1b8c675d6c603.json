As he is livelier and snappier than the others, one day he wanders into the forest alone. As soon as he arrives home, he discovers that his whole family has disappeared. Only later, he comes to know that the responsible are the feared humans, the hunters (called among animals the 'bare-skins'). But luckily for Vuk, his old uncle Karak starts to patronize him, and the seasoned elder brings Vuk up to be the most cunning and successful fox in the forest.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3820be3d90170ad753173083bc1b8c675d6c603","amp;dn":"Vuk+%28V.O.%29.DVDRIP.%5BSHEOL13%5D.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3820be3d90170ad753173083bc1b8c675d6c603","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,130,11,227,217,1,112,173,117,49,115,8,59,193,184,198,117,214,198,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
