Some are just a little more intimate than others. Jimmy jumps blindly into a relationship with Catherine while continuing to plan his wedding with Lucia. Meanwhile, he's blindsided when Dick hires a rival investigator. Worse still? The new snoop seems more interested in his co-worker's secrets than ferreting out insurance cons. And Jimmy has the most to hide.\n\nThe series airs on Showcase Canada.\n\nThe resolution is 608x352 and while the quality is not as good as a scene release due to my capture and encoding methods it is quite watchable in my opinion.\n\n\nSeries Info: Described as a cross between The Office and The Sopranos by the show's creator, Malcolm MacRury (ZOS: Zone of Separation, Deadwood), Cra$h &amp; Burn follows Jimmy Burn, a young claims adjuster for a cut-throat, bottom-line insurance corporation. Jimmy maneuvers his way around insurance scams and the criminal underworld as he tries to escape his past and make a better life on the gritty post-industrial streets of Hamilton.\n\nCra$h &amp; Burn stars Luke Kirby (Tell Me You Love Me, Slings and Arrows) as Jimmy Burn, the cocky yet charming up-and-comer looking to claim a piece of the corporate pie as an insurance adjuster. Casting also features Leela Savasta (Battlestar Galactica, Intelligence) as Lucia Silva, Jimmy's live-in girlfriend; Caroline Cave (The L Word, This Beautiful City) as Catherine Scott, a shrewd yet practical in-house insurance lawyer; Clark Johnson (The Wire, Homicide: Life on the Street, also an Emmy-nominated director on The Shield) as Walker Hearn, a veteran insurance investigator and Steve Bacic (The Guard, Andromeda) as Korkov, a conman and Mafioso hustling to scam the system.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d49fe485df8dc0d4184872841cd4731aa0143c0f","amp;dn":"Crash.%26.Burn.S01E09.Jump.WS.XviD-err0001.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d49fe485df8dc0d4184872841cd4731aa0143c0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,159,228,133,223,141,192,212,24,72,114,132,28,212,115,26,160,20,60,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
