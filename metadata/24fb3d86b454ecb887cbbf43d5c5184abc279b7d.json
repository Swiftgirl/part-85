Impossible to police, yet\n      steadily gaining public acceptance, the cannabis industry is now so\n      vast and vital to Canada's national economy that it can no longer be\n      ignored.\n\n      CannaBiz unfolds in Grand Forks, BC, a small border town nestled in\n      the Kootenay Mountains, where draft dodgers planted the first &quot;BC Bud&quot;\n      in the 1960s. After the pine beetle chewed through what was left of\n      the forest industry, marijuana became the backbone of the local economy.\n      In secret forest plots, basements, barns and high-tech underground\n      bunkers, growers nurture some of the world's most potent bud. Most of\n      the marijuana here, and in the rest of Canada, is destined for the US\n      market, where a pound of premium weed sells for a street price of $4,500.\n\n      Across the country, formerly laid-back marijuana growers now live in\n      fear of armed thieves, and smugglers take huge risks to cross the beefed\n      up American border. Conflicted police and RCMP officers like Harland\n      Venema continue to fight a seemingly futile battle. In Grand Forks,\n      Brian Taylor, once nicknamed &quot;the marijuana mayor&quot;, is campaigning for\n      medical marijuana as a prescription for economic prosperity. Ex con Sam\n      Mellace dreams of supplying medical marijuana nationally through Shoppers\n      Drug Mart outlets.\n\n      With inside access to growers, gangsters and police, CannaBiz untangles\n      the inner workings of the marijuana industry and raises serious questions\n      about Canada's drug laws. Stephen Easton, a leading Canadian economist,\n      recommends the end to marijuana prohibition, yet the government's\n      position is to get even tougher on an industry that now employs as many\n      Canadians as the auto industry. Are the staggering profits from the\n      cannabis industry better off in the pockets of hard-core smugglers and\n      criminal gangs, or would the Canadian economy benefit from taxing this\n      exploding industry?\n\n      CannaBiz is written and directed by Lionel Goddard and Chris Aikenhead\n      for Omni Film Productions in association with the Canadian Broadcasting\n      Corporation.\n\n   _______________________________________________________________________________\n\n                                    Yours truly","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24fb3d86b454ecb887cbbf43d5c5184abc279b7d","amp;dn":"Doc.Zone-CannaBiz.2010.HDTV.XviD-YT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24fb3d86b454ecb887cbbf43d5c5184abc279b7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,251,61,134,180,84,236,184,135,203,191,67,213,197,24,74,188,39,155,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
