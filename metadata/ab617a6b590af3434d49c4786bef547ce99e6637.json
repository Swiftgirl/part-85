It entered the UK albums chart at #7 and remains her highest charting album to date. It went on to be certified Gold by the BPI for sales in excess of 100,000 and Music Week confirmed sales stood at 215,000 in June 2004. Knight went on to receive several awards nomination with the project, most notably the prestigious Mercury Music Prize in 2002, and Best British Female and Best Urban Act at the 2003 Brit Awards.\n\nAmazon.co.uk Review By Reuben Dessay - Beverley Knight's third album, Who I Am shows how far the &quot;girl from Wolverhampton&quot; has come from her admittedly brilliant debut, B Funk. Knight, whose bright up-tempo R&amp;B songs have crossed age and genre barriers, is clearly making the most of being Britain's most popular soul singer since Sade. Knight has surrounded herself with some impressive producers and guests such as Musiq Soulchild flexing his Stevie Wonderish voice on the lovely ballad &quot;Beautiful Contradiction&quot;. Produced by James Poyser and Che Guevara, who between them have worked with Lauryn Hill, D'Angelo and Jill Scott, Beverley revels in impressing us with her gospel-great voice and her tight songwriting. The reggae-tinged &quot;Get Up&quot; and the funky &quot;Shoulda Woulda Coulda&quot; showcase Beverley's command of the dance floor and bear witness to her stunning range (vocally, emotionally and texturally). While her playful and sexy challenge of &quot;The Shape of You&quot; to the multifarious sounds of &quot;Same (As I Ever Was)&quot;, along with the Prince-esque &quot;Ambition (It All Comes 2 U)&quot;, demonstrate her undeniable hip-hop sensibility as well. Knight is obviously more comfortable with herself, as the push-me-pull-you tension of second album, Prodigal Sista, has given way to a much more upbeat direction. Who I Am quickly proves why Knight, unlike many of today's studio-enhanced artists, is the real deal.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Get Up!\n[02] Shoulda Woulda Coulda\n[03] Shape Of You\n[04] Fallen Soldier\n[05] Beautiful Contradiction\tWith Musiq Soulchild\n[06] Hurricane Jane\n[07] Same (As I Ever Was)\n[08] Whatever's Clever\n[09] Ambition (It All Comes 2 U)\n[10] Bestseller Mystery\n[11] Gold\n[12] Who I Am\n[13] Shoulda Woulda Coulda   \t[Philly Version]\n[14] Gold                   \t(Single Mix)\n\nMusic Videos\n\n[01] Get Up!
