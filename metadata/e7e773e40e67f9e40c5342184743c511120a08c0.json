Initial tests proved promising as subjects were experiencing heightened physical and mental strength and awareness. But, something in the experiment went horribly wrong and the island mysteriously lost three quarters of its population. Jamie Akerman fled the outbreak, which took her mothers life, twenty years ago. She now returns with her boyfriend and step brother, to sell the family property. There, they uncover the key to Jamie's disturbing past, and the horrifying secrets long suppressed by the town leader, Larkin. Now, a new strain of parasite has emerged, and threatens the island once again. Jamie struggles to survive and escape the obsessive pursuit of the local islanders who know that she has inherited more than she could ever have imagined.\n\nVideo Codec....: XviD-1.2.2\nVideo Bitrate..: 720 kbps\nAudio Codec....: AC3 5.1 ch\nAudio Bitrate..: 448 kbps\nAspect Ratio...: 2.31:1\nResolution.....: 592 x 256\nFrame Rate.....: 23.976 fps\nRuntime........: 90 mins\n\ncredit VoMiT &amp; to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone\n\n*****help what we can with haiti...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7e773e40e67f9e40c5342184743c511120a08c0","amp;dn":"Growth.2009.DVDRip.XviD-VoMiT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7e773e40e67f9e40c5342184743c511120a08c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,231,115,228,14,103,249,228,12,83,66,24,71,67,197,17,18,10,8,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
