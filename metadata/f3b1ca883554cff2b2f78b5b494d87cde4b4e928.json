Across the street is River City Tattoo Parlor, a place where many of the war-bound and returning soldiers go under the needle. An estimated 95 percent of the U.S. military sport tattoos. For those joining the ranks at Ford Hood, a pilgrimage to the River City Tattoo Parlor is an essential rite of passage.\n\n&quot;Tattooed Under Fire,&quot; directed by Nancy Schiesari, centers on the military ritual of getting inked, interweaving the personal stories of six central charactersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and their relationships to the war in IraqÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½with the visual expressions of their tattoos. The film is an intimate, character-driven portrait of Iraq-bound and returning U.S. soldiers, professing their pride, sharing their secrets and confessing their fears as they go under the tattoo needle. What emerges is an evocative, poignant and highly personal look at the human and cultural cost of war.\n\nRiver City Tattoo Parlor owner/artist Roxanne Willis and her team of tattoo artists welcome young men and women daily: as they arrive, shed their uniforms and carve permanence into their transitory flesh. Some seek to adorn their limbs, make a statement, ward off evil with fierce engravings or honor a loved one. Some seek grizzlier images, like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmeat tags.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ A play on traditional dog tags, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmeat tagsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are a morbid marker of name, DOB and serial number, designed for posthumous identification. Tattooed just under the armpit on the torso, they are strategically located in the place most likely to remain intact in the event of death by IED explosion. The young men and women are introduced as they are being tattooed; raw recruits at first and then as returning soldiers, changed in ways only their fellow soldiers can grasp. Through the creative and sometimes subversive act of tattooing, these young soldiers use skin to create personalized images and words that reveal a seldom seen part of the psyche of the American soldier.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 465 MiB for 56mn 38s 698ms\n\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\nLangiage          : English US\nSubtitles         : None\nGenre             : Documentary\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 998 Kbps\nAspect            : 528 x 384 (1.375) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 136 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3b1ca883554cff2b2f78b5b494d87cde4b4e928","amp;dn":"PBS.Tattooed+Under+Fire+%282009%29.PDTV.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3b1ca883554cff2b2f78b5b494d87cde4b4e928","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,177,202,136,53,84,207,242,178,247,139,91,73,77,135,205,228,180,233,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
