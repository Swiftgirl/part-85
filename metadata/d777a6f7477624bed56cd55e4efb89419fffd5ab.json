Lindsey (screenplay)\n&gt;         Kaneto ShindÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´ (motion picture &quot;Hachiko monogatari&quot;)\n&gt;\n&gt; Awards: \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tagline: A true story of faith, devotion and undying love.\n&gt;\n&gt; Plot Synopsis: This heartwarming true story is an American adaptation of a \n&gt; Japanese tale about a loyal dog named Hachiko. This very special friend \n&gt; would accompany his master to the train station every day and return each \n&gt; afternoon to greet him after work. Sadly his master departs one day, passes \n&gt; away and never returns to the station. Hachiko faithfully returns to the \n&gt; same spot at the station the very next day, and every day for the next nine \n&gt; years to wait for his beloved master. During his daily visits, Hachiko touches \n&gt; the lives of many who work near and commute through the town square. He teaches \n&gt; the local people love, compassion and above all unyielding loyalty. Today, a \n&gt; bronze statue of Hachiko sits in his waiting spot outside the Shibuya station \n&gt; in Japan as a permanent reminder of his devotion and love. It's almost like \n&gt; real life story, one who loves dogs can link up with this movie so badly. \n&gt;\n&gt; ScreenShots:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Shouts To:\n&gt; Ripwyn, Grey Shadow, Noir, Mustangx, Torrent Force, 1337x.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ENJOY!\n\n**********************************************************************\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.westy1983.org/forum/index.php?&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.westy1983.org/forum/index.php?&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d777a6f7477624bed56cd55e4efb89419fffd5ab","amp;dn":"Hachiko+A+Dog%5C%27s+Story%5B2009%5D+DvDrip+H.264+AAC+-+Westy1983","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d777a6f7477624bed56cd55e4efb89419fffd5ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,119,166,247,71,118,36,190,213,108,213,94,78,251,137,65,159,255,213,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
