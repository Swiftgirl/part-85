Also featured in this show is a short excerpt from a lecture by Harvard sociologist and noted public intellectual, Nathan Glazer.\n\nAbout the show\nBIG IDEAS offers a variety of thought-provoking topics which range across politics, culture, economics, art history, science.... The program has introduced Ontario viewers to the impressive brainpower of people like Niall Ferguson on American empire, Daniel Libeskind on architecture, Robert Fisk on the Middle East, George Steiner on the demise of literacy, Camille Paglia on aesthetic education, Tariq Ramadan on being a Western Muslim, Noam Chomsky on U.S. politics, Leon Kass on dying, Janice Stein on accountability and governance.\n\n&quot;BIG IDEAS is a showcase of ideas that shape our public debates. At their best the lectures featured on the program expose us to the differing ways of defining what matters and how that affects our understanding of the world as it is and as it is likely to be,&quot; adds Szemberg. &quot;Each age has a set of questions by which it defines itself. If, 50 years from now, someone came across a list of BIG IDEAS shows, they would have a pretty good idea of what people thought about and debated in the early 2000s.&quot;\n\nGeneral           : TVO BIG IDEAS-HOWARD GARDNER.Dec 6, 2009.PDTV.XviD.Ekolb\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 465 MiB for 57mn 38s 959ms\n\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\nLanguage          : English US\nSubtitles         : None\nGenre             : Educational\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 993 Kbps\nAspect            : 512 x 384 (1.333) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 122 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f026fb50fc8508cb987367092ab3158aa2b09bd","amp;dn":"TVO+BIG+IDEAS-Howard+Gardner.Dec+6%2C+2009.PDTV.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f026fb50fc8508cb987367092ab3158aa2b09bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,2,111,181,15,200,80,140,185,135,54,112,146,171,49,88,170,43,9,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
