The Rose of Washington Square is cast as Fanny Field, the long-suffering girlfriend of no-account, gin-swilling prizefighter Jerry Moore (Robert Armstrong). After sacrificing everything to advance Jerry's career, Fanny is &quot;repaid&quot; when Jerry dumps her in favor of femme fatale Lillian (Gertrude Astor). Our heroine gets her revenge by telling Jerry's ring opponent to &quot;go after&quot; her man's nose, which was recently reconstructed by plastic surgery. As a result, Jerry loses the bout, but comes to his senses, returning to Fanny for good. Highlights include Brice's takeoff of &quot;Dante's Inferno&quot; and her song solo &quot;Cookin' Breakfast for the One I Love,&quot; co-written by her then-husband Billy Rose. Unfortunately, the public didn't respond to Be Yourself, and Fanny Brice never again starred in a film, though she appeared as supporting player and guest performer from time to time. \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0020670/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0020670/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nDirector: Thornton Freeland\n\n\n\n\n        Fanny Brice\t ... \tFannie Field (as Fannie Brice)\n\tRobert Armstrong\t... \tJerry Moore\n\tHarry Green\t... \tHarry Field\n\tG.
