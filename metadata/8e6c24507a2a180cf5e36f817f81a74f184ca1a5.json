Players are\n  thrown back into the hustle and bustle of city\n  life to guide their amphibious friend, Frogger, from\n  the city back to his home marsh. Frogger Returns\n  stays true to the classic arcade gameplay style, but\n  is enhanced with improved graphics, a new camera\n  angle, and new levels. Streets, sewers, subways, and\n  numerous other obstacles and enemies are in play - all\n  for the sake of keeping Frogger away from returning\n  home! But Frogger isn't surrounded by just \n  hurdles -- new power-ups including time reverse,\n  invincibility and time freeze also aid Frogger in his travels.
