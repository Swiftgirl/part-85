These films, many of them acclaimed as being the finest works in the medium, reflect the composite learning acquired by the students at the Film &amp; Television Institute of India. These films are in a way, the points of departure for discourse amongst the next generation of connoisseurs of good films and experimentas with cinema.[/SIZE]\n\n[SIZE=&quot;2&quot;]Encompassing diverse genres and styles, individual expression is the common thread running through these films - cinema that bespeaks commitment and innovation.[/SIZE]\n\n[COLOR=&quot;DARKRED&quot;][SIZE=&quot;3&quot;][B]Uploader's Notes:[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]\n[SIZE=&quot;2&quot;]The films have been individually ripped and presented so that will fit into 2 CDs. The 5.1 Channel surround sound has been preserved, albeit in Nero AAC format, with very little loss in quality. The original frame size has been preserved (after cropping).\n\nAnd if someone wonders about the black borders, I have had to add them (or keep them) to preserve the hardcoded subtitles. I have reduced them or eliminated them wherever possible (thats why the frame sizes are different for some films).\n\nAlthough the video quality of these rips is excellent, If bandwidth isn't an issue, do download the XviD rips uploaded separately. The quality there is even better and the original AC3 6 Ch sound has been preserved.[/SIZE]\n\n[COLOR=&quot;DARKRED&quot;][SIZE=&quot;3&quot;][B]IMDB Link:[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]\nnot available. \n\n[/SIZE]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c9c02d758b87157fd613f25b0c033d21e3dd657","amp;dn":"Lensight+-+10+FTII+Diploma+films+on+2Cds+-+x264.AAC+DVD+rip+-+DD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c9c02d758b87157fd613f25b0c033d21e3dd657","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,156,2,215,88,184,113,87,253,97,63,37,176,192,51,210,30,61,214,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
