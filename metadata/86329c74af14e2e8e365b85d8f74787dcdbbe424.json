Lost has never had an episode under 40min.\n\nSo while we appreciate people rushing to release half a show, all it does is\ncause people to waste their bandwidth downloading the same thing 1.5 times and \ndelays the release of the second part thus making people even more angry. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86329c74af14e2e8e365b85d8f74787dcdbbe424","amp;dn":"Lost.S06E01-E02.PROPER.720p.HDTV.x264-2HD+%5BVelion%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86329c74af14e2e8e365b85d8f74787dcdbbe424","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,50,156,116,175,20,226,232,227,101,184,93,143,116,120,125,205,187,228,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
