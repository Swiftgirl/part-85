Dennis and his brother Terence, traveled to the AmazonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s La Chorrera seeking a hallucinogenic plant that enables the Witoto tribe to talk to elf-like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlittle men.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ These experiences seem to connect to the DMT, and psilocybin compound experiences as well.\n\nBut thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s possibly a greater connection to the UFO/alien phenomena you may or may not know about. In this episode weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll explore these compounds, their effects upon ingestion, and whether or not these ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhallucinationsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are opening an altered state of consciousness that allows for repeatable contact with the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œotherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Are these the UFO enigmaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œaliensÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½?\n\n-------------------\n\nExpanding Mind with Erik Davis - Dennis McKenna (08-30-09).mp3\n\n- http://davis.progressiveradionetwork.org/\n\nThis week's guest is Dennis McKenna, ethnobotanist, expert in the  pharmacology of ayahuasca and other visionary plants, and brother of legendary mushroom bard Terence McKenna. \n\n-------------------\n\nAlkaloids &amp; Evolution: (lecture from http://www.botanicalpreservationcorps.com/ converted from cassette to .wav to four 48kbps mp3 files)\n\nThe actual title of this lecture is &quot;Plant Allelochemicals and Plant/Human Co-Evolution&quot;, but it was abbreviated for economy of space. This should be of great interest to anyone who has pondered or actually studied the relationship between plant chemistry and human evolution. Dennis speaks from a well-informed and scientifically based perspective, but he is not afraid to elucidate his own theories about this important subject. Included among the issues he discusses is the question of why alkaloids and other so-called &quot;secondary&quot; plant compounds exist at all. While being somewhat technical in nature, this lecture should he accessible to anyone who has even the most rudimentary knowledge of plant chemistry.\n\n[img=http://botanicalpreservationcorps.com/indexbpc.gif]\n\nThe Ayahuasca (Hoasca) Project: (lecture from http://www.botanicalpreservationcorps.com/ converted from cassette to .wav to two 48kbps mp3 files)\n\nThe scarcity of hard data on the biodynamics of the long-term consumption of consciousness-altering plants has hindered scientific discussion on the subject, and has also allowed opponents of sacramental plant use to continue their demonizing of such plants while remaining largely unchallenged. Through the efforts of Dennis McKenna and a dedicated, multidisciplinary team of scientists that information void may eventually be replaced by an abundance of conclusive data. Following rigorous scientific methods, the Hoasca Project is conducting an ongoing, double-blind study of members of a Brazilian church who regularly ingest an ayahuasca potion as their sacrament. The participants constitute a typical cross-section of mostly middle-class Brazilian society, citizens in good community standing who are proud to take part in such an unprecedented study. The importance of this project to science cannot be overstated, and this report provides a comprehensive overview of the work in progress.\n\n-------------------\n\nThe Experiment at La Chorrera: (from the talking book 'True Hallucinations' read by Terence and Dennis McKenna - notes from Dennis' journal brought on their 1971 journey of discovery in the Amazon - eight 48kbps mp3 files)\n\n[img=http://photosynthesis.com/images-titles/A81-84.jpeg]\n\nA technology that would internalize the body and exteriorize the soul will develop parallel to the move to space. The Invisible Landscape, a book by my brother and myself, made an effort to short-circuit that chronology and, in a certain sense, to force the issue. It is the story, or rather it is the intelectual underpinnings of the story, of an expedition to the Amazon by my brother and myself and several other people in 1971. During that expedition, my brother formulated an idea that involved using harmine and harmaline, compounds that occur in  Banisteriopsis caapi, the woody vine that is the basis for ayahuasca. We undertook an effort to use harmine in conjunction with the human voice in what we called &quot;the experiment at La Chorrera.&quot; It was an effort to use sound to charge the molecular structure of harmine molecules metabolizing in the body in such a way that they would bind preferentially and permanently with endogenous molecular structures.\n\nOur candidate at the time was neural DNA, though Frank Barr, a researcher into the properties of brain melanin, has made a convincing case that there is as great a likelihood that harmine acts by binding with melanin bodies. In either case, the pharmacology involves binding with a molecular site where information is stored, and this information is then broadcast in such a way that one begins to get a mental readout on the structure of the soul. Our experiment was an effort to use a kind of shamanic technology to bell the cat, if you will, to hang a superconducting, telemetric device on the Overmind so that there would be a continuous readout of information from that dimension. The success or failure of this attempt may be judged for oneself.\n\nPurchase the audiobook on CD or cassette tape: \n\n- http://photosynthesis.com/Terence_Mckenna.html\n\nDownload the entire True Hallucinations audiobook: \n\n- http://www.geocities.com/ariainvictus/\n\n-\n\n[img=http://www.photosynthesis.com/images/banner4.jpg]\n\nMiguelito Lasky - Dave of True Hallucinations - The Experiment at La Chorrera.mp3\n\nMiguelito Lasky (1977) Experiment at La Chorera as told by ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDaveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.

The thesis is developed that at this critical historical juncture, ayahuasca has developed a strategy to broadcast its message to a wider world--a reflection of the urgent need to avert global ecological catastrophe. While ayahuasca has much to teach us, the critical question is, will humanity hear it, and heed it, in time? \n\n\nHuman Psychopharmacology of Hoasca.pdf\n\nA multinational, collaborative, biomedical investigation of the effects of hoasca (ayahuasca), a potent concoction of plant hallucinogens, was conducted in the Brazilian Amazon during the summer of 1993. This report describes the psychological assessment of 15 long-term members of a syncretic church that utilizes hoasca as a legal, psychoactive sacrament as well as 15 matched controls with no prior history of hoasca ingestion. Measures administered to both groups included structured psychiatric diagnostic interviews, personality testing, and neuropsychological evaluation. Phenomenological assessment of the altered state experience as well as semistructured and open-ended life story interviews were conducted with the long-term use hoasca group, but not the hoasca-naive control group. Salient findings included the remission of psychopathology following the initiation of hoasca use along with no evidence of personality or cognitive deterioration. Overall assessment revealed high functional status. Implications of this unusual phenomenon and need for further investigation are discussed. \n\n\nDennis McKenna - Neurochemistry and neurotoxicity of MDMA.pdf\n\n3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; also known as 'Ecstasy') is a ring-substituted phenylisopropylamine that is related to both amphetamines and hallucinogens, such as mescaline (Fig. 1). Although the drug was patented in 1914, interest in the compound was minimal until the past decade. During this period, MDMA began to be used as an adjunct to psychotherapy by certain therapists due to its purported ability to induce a state of reduced anxiety and lowered defensiveness (Downing, 1986; Greer and Tolbert, 1986). In addition, the recreational use of MDMA, particularly on college campuses, appears to have increased significantly in recent years (Peroutka, 1987). The human use of this agent is of concern due to the fact that MDMA and some of its congeners are selective serotonergic neurotoxins in laboratory animals. \n\nPartly as result of the recent interest in MDMA, numerous investigators have begun to explore the neurochemical effects of MDMA. During the past 3 years, over 80 publications on MDMA have appeared in the scientific literature. The following review attempts to provide a brief summary of recent data on the neurochemistry and neurotoxicity of MDMA and its derivatives. \n\n\nDennis and Terence McKenna - The Invisible Landscape\n\n[img=http://www.erowid.org/library/books/images/invisible_landscape.jpg]\n\n\nDennis McKenna - Foreword to Left in the Dark\n\n[img=http://leftinthedark.org.uk/images/display_thumbnail.jpg]\n\n- http://leftinthedark.org.uk/book\n\nLeft in the Dark expounds the most radical reinterpretation of existing evidence from the disciplines of evolution, ecology, neurology, psychology, anthropology and other academic fields, whilst also placing the ancient ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Ages of MankindÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ mythology and related traditions within a scientific context. These universal traditions were once the only version of history we had, they describe the onset and progression of a neurodegenerative condition that really has left us in the dark. Often considered no more than the imaginings of a primitive mind and easy to dismiss as mere myths, they are in fact a more accurate natural history of humankind than modern science has thus far recognised. The book outlines the origin and nature of a condition that eventually left us virtually blind to its existence. Evidence is cited that supports such a scenario. A means of definitively testing its validity is proposed and most importantly what can be done to treat the condition and prevent its occurrence. While this may seem a challenging prospect it promises amongst other things the restoration of phenomenal abilities, exceptional immune function and most importantly a greatly enhanced state of mind and well being only rarely glimpsed by a tiny minority. \n\nA neurodegenerative theory, such as the one outlined in Left in the Dark, which proposes that the development of our brain has become seriously retarded would accurately predict a number of major psychological symptoms.\n\nFor example making sense of who or what we are or recognising the insanity of our day to day behaviour would be virtually impossible.\n\nFurthermore such a theory would predict that  even if there were overwhelming evidence to support such a scenario we would be slow to understand the context, specific nature and severity of our predicament, even if it were pointed out in laypersons languageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2077e9043b1be692e8b46253f980ee35756798e3","amp;dn":"Dennis+McKenna%2C+PhD.+Co-Author+of+The+Invisible+Landscape+%28multi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2077e9043b1be692e8b46253f980ee35756798e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,119,233,4,59,27,230,146,232,180,98,83,249,128,238,53,117,103,152,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
