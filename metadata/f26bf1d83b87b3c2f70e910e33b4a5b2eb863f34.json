The box labeled Hard disk (no sandbox) shows changes by a program running normally. The box labeled Hard disk (with sandbox) shows changes by a program running under Sandboxie. The animation illustrates that Sandboxie is able to intercept the changes and isolate them within a sandbox, depicted as a yellow rectangle. It also illustrates that grouping the changes together makes it easy to delete all of them at once.\n\nBenefits of the Isolated Sandbox\n\n    * Secure Web Browsing: Running your Web browser under the protection of Sandboxie means that all malicious software downloaded by the browser is trapped in the sandbox and can be discarded trivially. \n\n    * Enhanced Privacy: Browsing history, cookies, and cached temporary files collected while Web browsing stay in the sandbox and don't leak into Windows. \n\n    * Secure E-mail: Viruses and other malicious software that might be hiding in your email can't break out of the sandbox and can't infect your real system. \n\n    * Windows Stays Lean: Prevent wear-and-tear in Windows by installing software into an isolated sandbox. \n\n(Windows 2000, XP, 2003, Vista, 7; 32-bit only)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f26bf1d83b87b3c2f70e910e33b4a5b2eb863f34","amp;dn":"Sandboxie+3.42-serial+incl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f26bf1d83b87b3c2f70e910e33b4a5b2eb863f34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,107,241,216,59,135,179,194,247,14,145,14,51,180,165,178,235,134,63,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
