The goal was to obtain a fresh installed OS with all the settings in the right place by default, rather than going manually through all the adjustments one by one. When you format and install a new OS you waste a lot of time, (setting up windows, registry setting, icons etc...)\n\n\nI used Windows 7 Professional as a base version for this release, simply because 7 Professional comes without backup and bit locker features. Dism has been used to integrate updates and removing useless packages like \\\\\\&quot;The upgrading version option\\\\\\&quot; (the annoying entry in the control panel that bothers you to update to the ultimate version), Country packages and others...\n\n\nVisual Customization: (default)\n\nSpecial ROG theme\nSystem icons\nSystem sounds\nWallpapers\nMedia center full customization\nMedia player (background changer)\nSystem Fonts (Only ROG THEME)\n\n\n\nDefault setting and registry setting:\n\nRemoved the imposed default 100 Mb Partition upon installation.
