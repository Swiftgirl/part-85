The game is on when the group is immediately ambushed and under enemy fire from all directions. But something doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t feel right. Suddenly, in the midst of bursting paint pellets, one of the players is hit by a real bullet. Confusion reigns until they realise that this is no longer a game, it is a manhunt. One by one they fall into the traps set by an invisible enemy. Their only chance of survival is to fight with whatever means necessary.\n\nGenre: Action | Horror | Thriller\nIMDB rating: 4.4/10 (107 votes)\nDirected by: Daniel Benmayor\n\nRelease Name: Paintball.2009.DVDRip.XviD-VoMiT\nSize: 50ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€15 MB\nVideo: 640 x 272 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 970 kbps\nAudio: English ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ MP3 VBR Stereo ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 160 kbps\nRuntime: 85 mins\nFilename: vmt-paintball-xvid","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67f7a917d4a8bf4de64057d3719865f62655e3d7","amp;dn":"Paintball+2009+DVDRip+XviD-VoMiT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67f7a917d4a8bf4de64057d3719865f62655e3d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,247,169,23,212,168,191,77,230,64,87,211,113,152,101,246,38,85,227,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
