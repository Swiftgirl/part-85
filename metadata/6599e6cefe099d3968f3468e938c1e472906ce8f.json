More to come.\n\n\n\nHi folks,\n\nafter all this whining from people that used the Easyaccount and cried about no chance to reset the stats, here is a new hack that helps you to set your stats to amounts that YOU wish. No funny playerstats file, that so many else are using. no problems with banns and VAC.\n\nYou can even change the Prestige Level! and you can even downgrade your stats. Do as you wish :)\n\nBut GUYS! Dont be silly again and use this trainer smart. It is just fishy, if you set your prestige to 5 and level to 70, but got only 15 kills ;)\n\n\nHow to use:\n\nJust start the multiplayer game, go to your stats screen and note the stats you want to change. Alt+Tab out of game. Then start the trainer and set the right amounts. Again ingame press the right key combo and be happy about your new personal stats. You can change them again outside the game and ingame activate the combo again to update.\n\nFor weapon stats it more complicated: You just have to set the amount to -1 of the needed to reach the next level of upgrade, then make a kill under the required circumstances. Note the next needed amount and set again to -1, and so on.\n\n\nYou can start the trainer first too and press launch, then navigate to the games folder (looks like ...ValveSteamSteamAppscommoncall of duty modern warfare 2) and choose the iw4mp.exe.\n\n\nHere some Exp amounts for levels:\n\n10: 29700\n20: 142700\n30: 355700\n40: 679700\n50: 1123700\n60: 1704200\n70: 2434700\n\n\n\nHave fun and cheat smart ;)\n\n\nP.S. YOU ARE CHEATING ON YOU OWN RESPOSIBILITY!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6599e6cefe099d3968f3468e938c1e472906ce8f","amp;dn":"CoD+Modern+Warfare+2+MultiPlayer+Trainer+%2B21+v1.0.172","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6599e6cefe099d3968f3468e938c1e472906ce8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,153,230,206,254,9,157,57,104,243,70,142,147,140,30,71,41,6,206,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
