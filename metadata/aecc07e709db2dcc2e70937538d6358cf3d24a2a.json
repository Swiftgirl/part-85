You can still get the original  files over at infocom-if.org/downloads/downloads.html, as well as the original Mac binaries. That is, if you're looking to play it on an OS9. All three games run under DOSBox 0.72  DOSBOX.com , and I included a custom menu so there's no modifying configuration files to swap games.\n\nI've also included the original Manuals in PDF format  #   for those who are either new to Zork, or too old to remember how to play!\n\nIt's a universal  #   binary, and should run on PPC. Tested on 10.6.2, runs great! \n\nWARNING: When saving games, do not use a filename, the designated zork#.dat file will store your game. If you choose to make a separate save file, place it in its own folder or make the name unique enough that you won't, for example, open a Zork 2 save in Zork 3.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aecc07e709db2dcc2e70937538d6358cf3d24a2a","amp;dn":"Zork+I%2C+II%2CIII+for+OSX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aecc07e709db2dcc2e70937538d6358cf3d24a2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,204,7,231,9,219,45,204,46,112,147,117,56,214,53,140,243,210,74,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
