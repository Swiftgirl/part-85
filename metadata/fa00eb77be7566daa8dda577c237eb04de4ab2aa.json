Until PlayClaw nothing worked too good with modern games, because cutting edge games try to hog every ounce of your PC's power, leaving little available to other applications. This results in choppy video, distorted still shots or massive bitmap files.\n\nAt A Glance: \nCapture screenshots, capture game video with optional recording game audio\nAdjustable video recording frame rate and file sizes\nOutput in multiple formats\nVarious helpful overlays: Ventrilo/Teamspeak overlay, performance overlays, video recording statistics, GPU thermal sensors\nNew! Teamspeak 3 overlays\nNo slowdown with multicore CPUs\nPlays nice with Vista and Win7","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa00eb77be7566daa8dda577c237eb04de4ab2aa","amp;dn":"playclaw.1.8.0.760.cracked.exe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa00eb77be7566daa8dda577c237eb04de4ab2aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,0,235,119,190,117,102,218,168,221,165,119,194,55,235,4,222,74,178,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
