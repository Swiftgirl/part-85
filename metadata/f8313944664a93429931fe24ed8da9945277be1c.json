Print the resulting booklet PDF, which BookLightning typically creates in less than a second, fold the pages and staple. Done.\nAll you need to do is set up your original document at exactly the size you want for the booklet, which will be 1/2 the size of the paper you are printing on as the pages get folded in half.\nFor the frequent booklet-maker, BookLightning even includes a convenient direct-print feature that lets you print booklets (via BookLightning) straight from the print panel of your application.\n\nPdfCompress\n\nPdfCompress is a Mac OS X utility for reducing the size of PDF files. Just drop your file on the PdfCompress icon and it will quickly create a new, compressed PDF file suitable for sending via e-mail or posting on the Web.\nPdfCompress features a wide variety of compression methods (including LZW, Flate, JPEG, font removal, CCITTT Group 4, dead-object stripping, metadata removal) and automaticallly chooses the most appropriate options for your file, yielding compression ratios of up to 10x or more for a wide variety of files. We do recommend you try PdfCompress with your files before you buy a license, as compression varies due not least to fundamental axioms of information theory not all files can be compressed.\nPdfCompress never modifies your original file, and always names result files in a manner that indicates they've been compressed, so you can be sure that your data is safe and you won't send or post the wrong file accidentally.\n\nTextLightning\n\nTextLightning is a Mac OS X native utility for converting PDF files to formatted richt text format. TextLightning reconstructs as much of the original formatting as possible, including fonts, paragraphs, justification, margins and international characters as well as ligatures.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nOS version: 10.4 and later\n\n--&gt;&gt; PLEASE SEED &lt;&lt;--\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8313944664a93429931fe24ed8da9945277be1c","amp;dn":"Metaobject+Softwares+with+sn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8313944664a93429931fe24ed8da9945277be1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,49,57,68,102,74,147,66,153,49,254,36,237,141,169,148,82,119,190,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
