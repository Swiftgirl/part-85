They are investigating the disappearance of Rachel Solando (Emily Mortimer), a patient who vanished from a locked room. Dr. John Cawley (Ben Kingsley), the head psychiatrist, explains that Rachel was institutionalized after drowning her three children. She believes, however, that she is still home and that her children are still alive.\nThe cliffs surrounding the perimeter make it impossible for Rachel to have reached the nearby caves. Teddy sees a lighthouse but is told it has already been searched. The Marshals question the staff and learn that RachelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s psychiatrist, Dr. Sheehan, left for vacation that morning. Teddy asks to see the hospitalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s personnel files but Cawley refuses. That night, Teddy has strange dreams about his wife, Dolores (Michelle Williams), who died in a fire two years before. She tells him Rachel is still on the island, as is Andrew Laeddis, the man who started the fire.\nIn the morning, they interview patients from RachelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s group therapy sessions, one of whom passes Teddy a warning to run. Teddy explains to Chuck the real reason he took the case: after being transferred to Ashecliff, Andrew Laeddis disappeared. When Teddy investigated, he met a former patient who claimed that the facility was performing human experiments. Rachel is finally found near the lighthouse but she is unresponsive to TeddyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s questioning. He eventually finds George Noyce (Jackie Earle Haley), the man who told him about the experiments. George says that the whole situation is a game for TeddyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s benefit and that he is afraid of being taken to the lighthouse.\nTeddy tries to reach the lighthouse and discovers a cave where the real Rachel Solando (Patricia Clarkson) is hiding. She was a doctor at Ashecliff until she found out about the experiments and was committed as a patient. She explains that the hospital is using psychotropic medication in an attempt to master mind control, with the goal of creating sleeper agents for use in the Cold War. She says that Teddy has been similarly drugged since he arrived on the island.\nTeddy finally makes it to the lighthouse and finds Cawley waiting at the top. The doctor reveals that Teddy is actually Andrew Laeddis. He murdered his manic depressive wife after she drowned their three children, and then created a fantasy where he was a hero to cope with the pain. He invented Rachel Solando as part of his delusion. He has been under the care of Dr. Sheehan, the man he thought was Chuck, for two years. Sheehan and Cawley decided to try a roleplay experiment, allowing Andrew to live out his delusions in an attempt to bring him back to reality.\nAndrewÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s memory comes back and he makes peace with his past, but later he appears to have a relapse and Cawley is forced to lobotomize him. Before the surgery is performed, Andrew asks Dr. Sheehan if he thinks it would be worse to live as a monster or die as a good man, leaving it unclear whether he had a relapse or is feigning delusion in order to have a permanent escape from reality. The film ends with an ambiguous shot of the lighthouse.\n\n\nFile Size: 397MB\nFile Extention: Matroska MKV\nResolution: 608x256\nDuration: 2:10:17\n\n\nScreenshoots:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/cALpaaAcf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/cALpaaAcf&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n&quot;Sharing is caring&quot; so please seed as much as you can.\n\n\nA simple thank you will be appreciated.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb4527c29f427cd8cbc12b8e00b06db6a5ce3306","amp;dn":"Shutter+Island+%282010%29+R5.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb4527c29f427cd8cbc12b8e00b06db6a5ce3306","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,69,39,194,159,66,124,216,203,193,43,142,0,176,109,182,165,206,51,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
