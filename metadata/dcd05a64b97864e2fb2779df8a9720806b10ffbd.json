He was born in Leiden, Netherlands, but grew up in Koudekerk aan den Rijn. In 2007, 2008, and 2009 he was voted number one DJ in DJ MagÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s annual Top 100 vote. Van Buuren currently hosts a weekly radio show called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA State of TranceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and claims to have over 30 million weekly listeners in more than 40 countries, which would make it the most listened to radio show in the world. Armin van Buuren was born in Leiden, the Netherlands on December 25, 1976. He finished high school in 1995, and left for college to study law. While studying law, Van BuurenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s interest for making music blossomed, and he began working as a DJ in a local club called Nexus. As his musical career began to take off, he temporarily put his law degree on hold, however, he did complete his law degree in 2004 via Oxford University.. On September 18, 2009 Armin married Erika van Thiel in Wassenaar, Netherlands.\n\nFerry (System F) Corsten\n\nFerry Corsten, also known under the alias System F, (born December 4, 1973 in Rotterdam, Netherlands) is a producer of trance music, in addition to being a DJ and remixer. He also hosts his own weekly radio show, CorstenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Countdown. He routinely plays at events all over the world with crowds in excess of tens of thousands. On October 28, 2009, DJ Magazine announced the results of their annual Top 100 DJ Poll, placing Ultra Records artist Corsten at #7. Ferry Corsten produced and remixed under many aliases since the release of his first record at the age of sixteen, but he officially started to work as a musician when he was 27 years old. As a teenager he would listen to his fatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s record player and he would save money to buy his first keyboard by washing cars, and selling mixed tapes to kids in his neighborhood. He later began to perform live performances with a friend and won his first award ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDe Grote Prijs van NederlandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ at Holland in 1989.\n\nShared from the Trance group at &quot;hexagoncc&quot; Check it out for all of the latest in Trance and Progressive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcd05a64b97864e2fb2779df8a9720806b10ffbd","amp;dn":"System+F+vs+Armin+Van+Buuren+-+TranceMatch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcd05a64b97864e2fb2779df8a9720806b10ffbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,208,90,100,185,120,100,226,251,39,121,223,138,151,32,128,107,16,255,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
