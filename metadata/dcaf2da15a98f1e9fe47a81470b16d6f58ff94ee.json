While some of the new functionality may not appeal, the most significant changes are major improvements to what was already a very good piece of software. Strongly recommended. \n\nThere are a few utilities out there which can make your life so much easier, you wouldn't contemplate living without them. As someone who works on the web, I'm taking screenshots all the time and SnagIt is the only tool I'd use for this vital element of my job. \n\nIn its latest incarnation, SnagIt has added a lot of new features and a jazzed-up interface. While the old familiar 'big red button' remains, much of the UI (particularly in the Editor window) has been completely overhauled. Gone is the XP blue of previous versions, replaced with a Vista-friendly charcoal look which works pretty well. \n\nThe program's key features (taking and editing screenshots) remain pretty much unchanged. You still have a huge amount of power of just what type of screenshot you can take, with timers, cursor settings and profiles all still playing a major role. I was pleased to see that my profiles from the last version of SnagIt were kept as it would have been a real nuisance to have to re-program them. \n\nThe biggest improvements to this new version are certainly connected to the Editor window. For example: whereas previously, you had to take a capture, work on it, save it and then take your next one; now you can take as many screenshots as you like, using whichever profiles, and work on them all as you wish. This is a huge time-saver and a very welcome addition to the program. \n\nAnother feature that has been added is of less obvious use. SnagIt now supports meta-tagging and labeling of captured images. The idea behind this feature is that you start to use SnagIt to categorize your images as well as capture them. I can understand the thinking behind this addition but I'm not sure if it's really much more than feature-creep. I can't see myself changing my workflow to fit with SnagIt, nor do I want to lose the capability of moving image files around at will (if you use Windows Explorer to move tagged images, the tags and labels are lost). \n\nCapture Features \n\n* Sequential capture \n* New Visual Design \n* Capture Web Pages with Links \n* Capture All File Types From the Web \n* Improved Desktop Integration \n* Banner and Domain Blocking Technology added to Web Capture \n* Enhanced Web Capture \n* Enhanced Auto Scroll Capture \n* Import and Export Capture Profiles \n* Capture profile interface \n* Capture profile wizard \n* SnagIt OneClick interface \n* Microsoft Outlook add-in \n* Microsoft Excel Add-In \n* 16 New File Formats \n* Adobe Framemaker Plug-in \n* Microsoft Word Add-In \n* Microsoft PowerPoint Add-In \n* Internet Explorer Add-In \n* COM Server Interface \n* Printer Capture \n* Extended Windows Capture \n* Web Capture \n* DirectX Capture \n* Layered Windows Capture \n* Multiple Region Capture \n* Delayed and Scheduled Capture \n* TWAIN support \n* Irregular Shape Capture \n* Horizontal Scrolling Windows \n* Object Capture \n* Digital Camera files: JPEG and TIFF \n* Audio Recording \n* Transparent GIF \n* Cascaded Menu Capture \n* BMP, GIF, JPEG, TIFF, PCX, PNG, interlaced GIF, progressive JPEG \n* Slow AVI Capture and Playback \n* Fixed Region Capture \n* Text Capture \n* Video Capture \n\nCompatible with: Windows 2000, XP (32-bit or 64-bit), Vista (32-bit or 64-bit) \nLanguage: English ( Incl.
