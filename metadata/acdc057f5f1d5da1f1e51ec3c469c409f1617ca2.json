The work follows the exploits of Spartacus, the leader of the slave uprising against the Romans known as the Third Servile War, although the ballet's storyline takes considerable liberties with the historical record. Khachaturian composed the ballet in 1954, and for this was awarded a Lenin Prize that year[1]. It was first staged, with choreography by Leonid Yakobson, in Leningrad 1956[2], but only with qualified success since Yakobson abandoned conventional pointe in his choreography[3]. The ballet received its first staging at the Bolshoi Theatre, Moscow in 1958, choreographed by Igor Moiseev; however it was the 1968 production, choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich, which achieved the greatest acclaim for the ballet[2]. It remains one of Khachaturian's best known works and is prominent within the repertoires of the Bolshoi Theatre and other ballet companies in Russia  and the former Soviet Union.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spartacus_%28ballet%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spartacus_%28ballet%29&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khachaturian&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khachaturian&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalia_Bessmertnova&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalia_Bessmertnova&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Vasiliev_%28ballet_dancer%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Vasiliev_%28ballet_dancer%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:32:41\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 640x480  4:3\nCodec : DivX 5\nFPS : 30,00\nBitRate : 1047 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,12 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 44100 Hz\nBitRate : 192 Kbps\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acdc057f5f1d5da1f1e51ec3c469c409f1617ca2","amp;dn":"SPARTACUS++%28Khachaturian%29++V+Vasiliev%2C+N+Bessmertnova%29++Bolshoi%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acdc057f5f1d5da1f1e51ec3c469c409f1617ca2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,220,5,127,95,29,93,161,241,229,30,195,196,105,196,9,241,97,124,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
