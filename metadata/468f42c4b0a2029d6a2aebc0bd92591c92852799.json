The 24bit definition makes the sound richer and cleaner than ever. With this conversion, you can now hear it in spectacular surround.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe conversion was done using the SPEC method (ArcTan set to &quot;across&quot; with Slice rears) found on http://www.surroundbyus.com.\n\nThe files are only playable on home theater equipment or PC's capable of decoding a DTS signal. Otherwise, you will hear static. You have several options, including the following:\n\na) Foobar2000: Install the foo_input_dts plugin and load the cue file directly into your playlist.\n\nb) Mount the cue file on a virtual drive (with Daemon Tools, for example) and play with a DTS-capable player (Cyberlink PowerDVD, for example).\n\nc) Burn the cue file to a CD as an image (with ImgBurn or Ahead Nero, for example) and play on a DTS-capable Home Theater system.\n\nEnjoy and please give some feedback!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:468f42c4b0a2029d6a2aebc0bd92591c92852799","amp;dn":"Beatles+-+Abbey+Road+%2824bit%29+%28DTS+5.0%29+%28SBU%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"468f42c4b0a2029d6a2aebc0bd92591c92852799","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,143,66,196,176,162,2,157,106,42,235,192,189,146,89,28,146,133,39,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
