The album is meant to be released in the first half of 2010.\n\nThe music video for its first single &quot;Hold on&quot; is gaining immense applaud by its viewers. The song was recorded in early 2009 as a tribute song to Wyclef's native land Haiti. It was written months before the 2010 Haiti earthquake, which devastated the country. However, now the tune has an added depth given the circumstances.\n\nNeluset Wyclef Jean (born October 17, 1972) is a Haitian-American multi-platinum musician, rapper, and record producer.\n\nIn 2005, Jean established the YÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©le Haiti Foundation. In its first year of operation, the foundation, with funding by Comcel, provided scholarships to 3,600 children in GonaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯ves, Haiti, after the devastation by Hurricane Jeanne. In its second year of operation, it is almost doubling the amount of the scholarships and spreading them throughout Haiti, providing tuition in 5 regions. The foundation aims to provide 6,800 scholarships to children in Port-au-Prince, GonaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯ves, Les Cayes, Port-de-Paix, and Cap-HaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯tien.\n\nThe Foundation filed its tax forms for 2005ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2007 all in August 2009, a delay Charity Navigator characterized as &quot;odd&quot; even among charities, and &quot;beyond late&quot;. Much of YÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©le Haiti's money has been paid out to Wyclef Jean, his relative and fellow YÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©le Haiti director Jerry Duplessis, or companies they own. For example, the Foundation claimed about $1,000,000 in revenue for 2006, but paid $250,000 to Telemax, a television station controlled by Jean and Duplessis, $31,000 to rent its own offices from Platinum Sound owned by Jean and Duplessis, and $100,000 for Jean's own performance at a benefit concert in Monaco, when Jean had been paid only $40,000 as headliner at 2002 festival at the top of his career with the Fugees.\n\nHugh Locke, president of YÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©le Haiti, said &quot;I think people should be very comfortable that any money given to YÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©le Haiti is going 100 percent to emergency relief.&quot; and that the group hopes to increase the percentage of its budget on services as it gains experience. He described the concert payments as &quot;not our finest hour&quot;. A spokeman for YÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©le Haiti's public relations firm described paying Jean's and Duplessis' companies as an opportunity to receive services at a &quot;severely reduced&quot; rate and a &quot;significant discount&quot;.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0542bfd3ef8fb8b8236b942990f8839d61b11679","amp;dn":"Wyclef+Jean+feat.+Mavado+-+Hold+On++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0542bfd3ef8fb8b8236b942990f8839d61b11679","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,66,191,211,239,143,184,184,35,107,148,41,144,248,131,157,97,177,22,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
