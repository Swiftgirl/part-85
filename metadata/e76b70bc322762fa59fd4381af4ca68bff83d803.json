When  \n                    Jerry, an ex-serving corporal recently returned  \n                    from Helmand, and his wife Emma, report a  \n                    friend and fellow soldier, Darren missing, MJ  \n                    is concerned for the well-being of this popular  \n                    member of the Kent Regiment. Her fears for his  \n                    safety are raised further when she discovers  \n                    that a shotgun has disappeared.
