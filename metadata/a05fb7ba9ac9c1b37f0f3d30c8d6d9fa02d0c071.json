The majority of the recordings are from the 1995-1997 tours and feature the full original lineup of Billy, James, D'Arcy and Jimmy playing the songs fresh off recording the album.\n\nEach song was selected for quality as well as uniqueness. However for some of the lesser played songs there weren't exactly a lot of options. Some of the transitions are also kind of weak in spots. I spent very little time tweaking. I guess I just  wanted to throw it up and see what happened. There are some very cool versions on here that new fans should hear. When I have some more time I'll consider releasing a 2.0 version with all the audio levels synced and the transitions smoothed out, and maybe 1-3 song replacements if I end up deciding on some different versions.\n\nThanks to all the tapers who throw their boots up on the archive, as that's where most of this is poached from. Your good people.\n\n\n\nContents:\nDisc 1: Dawn to Dusk\nDisc 2: Twilight to Starlight\nDisc 3: Bonus Disc\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for listening, I hope you enjoy the mix. If you do, please seed.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a05fb7ba9ac9c1b37f0f3d30c8d6d9fa02d0c071","amp;dn":"Time+is+Never+Time+At+All%3A+Mellon+Collie+and+the+Infinite+Sadnes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a05fb7ba9ac9c1b37f0f3d30c8d6d9fa02d0c071","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,95,183,186,154,201,193,179,127,15,61,48,200,214,217,250,2,208,192,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
