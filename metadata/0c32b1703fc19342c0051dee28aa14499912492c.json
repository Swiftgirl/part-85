It is a new type of show, at least for us, and the first time we have both done a format such as this.\n\n    This is how it works. Aq and I are going to record a series of bite-sized shows which we are referring to as shots. Each shot will be about 10 minutes long and cover a given topic. We will release each shot at www.shotofjaq.org where you can listen to the juicy nugget of fun right from your web browser or alternatively, download the show in MP3 and Ogg format. We will also have podcast feeds.\n\n    A key part of Shot Of Jaq will be encouraging discussion when a show is released. With LugRadio we did this by releasing a show and creating a thread on the LugRadio Forums, and the community would discuss the topics there. With Shot Of Jaq, the discussion takes place right there on the website where you can listen to and download the show. This makes it a doddle to listen to the show and get involved in the discussion.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c32b1703fc19342c0051dee28aa14499912492c","amp;dn":"ShotOfJaq-Episodes-1-20","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c32b1703fc19342c0051dee28aa14499912492c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,50,177,112,63,193,147,66,192,5,29,238,40,170,20,73,153,18,73,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
