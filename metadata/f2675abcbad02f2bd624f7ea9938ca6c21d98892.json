A rash of horrific murders committed by apparently ordinary people rocks Gotham City to its core - and when Harvey Dent, the horribly scarred criminal known as Two-Face, escapes from Arkham Asylum, Batman realizes he's involved. But Two-Face has plans for Batman, using him as a live test subject for a terrifying new drug, with a grim purpose: to kill his &quot;good&quot; side, and allow the scarred face to reign supreme.\n\nWritten by Paul Jenkins, with art by Jae Lee and Sean Phillips.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2675abcbad02f2bd624f7ea9938ca6c21d98892","amp;dn":"Batman+-+Jekyll+and+Hyde","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2675abcbad02f2bd624f7ea9938ca6c21d98892","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,103,90,188,186,208,47,43,214,36,247,234,153,56,202,108,33,217,136,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
