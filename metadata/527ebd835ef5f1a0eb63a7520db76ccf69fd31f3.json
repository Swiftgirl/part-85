Jeanne Moreau is Celestine, a beautiful Parisian domestic who, upon arrival at her new job at an estate in provincial 1930s France, entrenches herself in sexual hypocrisy and scandal with her philandering employer (BuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±uel regular Michel Piccoli). Filmed in luxurious black-and-white Franscope, Diary of a Chambermaid is a raw-edged tangle of fetishism and murderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and a scathing look at the burgeoning French fascism of the era.\n\nMOVIE:\nORIGINAL TITLE: Le journal d'une femme de chambre\nDIRECTOR: Luis BuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±uel\nCOUNTRY: France\nYEAR: 1964\n\nDVD:\nDVD RELEASE: June 5, 2001\nSTUDIO: Criterion\nSYSTEM: NTSC\nCOLOR: Grayscale\nSCREEN: 2.35:1\nAUDIO: French Dolby Digital 1.0\nSUBTITLES: English Subtitles\nRUNTIME (MOVIE): 98 minutes\n\nEXTRACTION:\nENGINE: MacTheRipper 3.0 (R14m)\nDVD: 1 Full Dual-Layer DVD\nFILE EXTENSION: .ISO (Image)\nFILE SIZE: 6.13 GBs\nSCANS: Full Art Scan + Booklet\nSCANS FORMAT: PDF (FROM 600DPI Original)\nBOOKLET FORMAT: PDF (FROM 600DPI Original)\nSCANS FILE SIZE: 38.9 MBs\nTOTAL FILE SIZE: 6.17 GBs\n*Sizes in decimal format\n\nDISC FEATURES:\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Spectacular new widescreen transfer, with digitally restored image and sound and enhanced for 16ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€9 televisions\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Video interview with screenwriter and longtime BuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±uel collaborator Jean-Claude CarriÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Transcript of a late 1970s interview with director Luis Bunuel\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Original theatrical trailer, narrated by Jeanne Moreau\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ New and improved English subtitle translation\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Optimal image quality: RSDL dual-layer edition\n\n\nABOUT THIS TORRENT:\n- Please enable DHT AND PEX\n- Download at will, but please be a good leech and help seed if you can!\n\n\nAll my posts are scanned/ripped by myself.\nGET A LIFE COPYCAT-LAMERS!
