Filtered synths, dirty beats and chunky sub-bass propel this debut in to the heart of the dance floor.\n\n\n\nThe Horror\n\nLiving up to its name, The Horror oozes panic stricken synth tones and bit crunched effects that battle to create an ominous intro vibe. The resonating bass stabs and heavy sub bass groove over floor pumping kicks and sleazy snares in this slice of upfront Dubstep dance floor mayhem.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cd82c249f3e70a6b53bb33272a4c420162501b8","amp;dn":"Radical+Project+-+Laser+%26+The+Horror+-+Urban+Sickness+Audio+%28USA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cd82c249f3e70a6b53bb33272a4c420162501b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,216,44,36,159,62,112,166,181,59,179,50,114,164,196,32,22,37,1,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
