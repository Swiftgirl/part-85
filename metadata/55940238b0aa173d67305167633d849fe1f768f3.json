IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m a little surprised. Who knew Texas had a Board of Education? The new\nsocial studies curriculum will put a conservative stamp on history. More accurately, it will stamp out any history\nthatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not conservative.\n\n\n\nAs the nationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s second-largest textbook market, Texas has enormous leverage over publishers, who make their standard\ntextbooks conform to the specifications of their biggest customers. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s free-market economics for youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½if enough\npeople are ignorant, then everybody has to be ignorant. As The Washington Monthly said, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwhen it comes to textbooks,\nwhat happens in Texas rarely stays in Texas.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½  At least the textbooks should come with some kind of disclaimer. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe\ncontents of this book arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t true anywhere except Texas.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Maybe the simplest textbook disclaimer would just say\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWarning: contents under extreme pressureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ from ultra-conservative nutbags.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\n\nThe Texas Board of Education made some huge changes. In the world of education in Texas from now on the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthree\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“RÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are going to be ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œreading, writing, and revisionism.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Conservatives donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t like Thomas Jefferson\nbecause he coined the term ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œseparation between church and state.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ So the Board removed Jefferson from a section of\nthe Texas curriculum, replacing him with St. Thomas Aquinas, John Calvin, and others. If you have no idea who John\nCalvin is, donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t worry. That means you probably have a pretty accurate knowledge of real American history. The board\nalso now requires that students learn about ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe conservative resurgence of the 1980s and 1990s, including Phyllis\nSchlafly, the Contract With America, the Heritage Foundation, the Moral Majority and the National Rifle Association.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nHey, I want kids to learn about all that stuff. Well, not so much learn about it, as be warned about it. It looks like\nthe only thing these Texans want anybody to remember is the Alamo. And they donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want people to remember that\naccurately. The hard-right conservatives on the Texas Board of Education probably want textbooks to say that Phyllis\nSchaflaly was at the Alamo.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55940238b0aa173d67305167633d849fe1f768f3","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+March+15+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55940238b0aa173d67305167633d849fe1f768f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,148,2,56,176,170,23,61,103,48,81,103,99,61,132,159,225,247,104,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
