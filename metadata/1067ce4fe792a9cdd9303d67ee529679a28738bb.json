This DVD program follows the Allied armies as they begin the invasion of Nazi Germany. \n\nWitness the critical battles that led to the breaching of the Siegfried Line; the Nazi's Ardennes Counteroffensive and the Battle of the Bulge which finally broke it off; and the final breaching of the Rhine River at Remagen and the infamous Remagen Bridge.
