According to the lyrics, Jones' mother reveals that her grandfather was a musician who traveled with Nat King Cole, womanizing and drinking from town to town. The song describes her family's lament that she isn't more of a Jones like her sister or brother Noel while she expresses her desire to be free.\nTime Out London describes the composition as &quot;among the most personal songs sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ever recorded, celebrating the contradictions between GraceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s religious family background and outrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© public persona.&quot;  The Independent says the song &quot;employs handclaps and choral refrain to build up an almost gospel fervour&quot;.\n\nIn the song's introduction Jones distorts a line from the first stanza of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; declaring, &quot;You can't save a wretch like me.&quot; At the end of the track when Jones sings the first two lines of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; Jones' mother Marjorie, a lyric soprano, can be heard singing the same hymn in church.\n\nThe song's working title was &quot;Keeping up with the Joneses&quot;, an idiom heard in the lyrics.\n\nJones performed the number live on Later... with Jools Holland with her son, Paulo Goude, on percussion.\n\nBelgian duo Stephen Fasano and Vito De Luca of the band Aeroplane produced a Balearic disco remix of the single which was initially rejected by Jones' label but eventually approved. 1,000 12&quot; singles were released featuring mixes by Aeroplane, Mad Professor, Greg Wilson and Ivor Guest.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f28e04d96bc3b283b121fe1f32bed527f849842","amp;dn":"Grace+Jones+-+Williams%5C%27+Blood+%5B2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f28e04d96bc3b283b121fe1f32bed527f849842","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,40,224,77,150,188,59,40,59,18,31,225,243,43,237,82,127,132,152,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
