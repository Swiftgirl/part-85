In a twist on Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, Ebenezer Blackadder is the &quot;kindest and loveliest&quot; man in England. The Spirit of Christmas shows Blackadder the contrary antics of his ancestors and descendants, and reluctantly informs him that if he turns evil his descendants will enjoy power and fortune, while if he remains the same a future Blackadder will live shamefully subjugated to a future incompetent Baldrick. This remarkable encounter causes him to proclaim, &quot;Bad guys have all the fun&quot;, and adopt the personality with which viewers are more familiar.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75a7a1433afcaeb989d69a084615bd800ae27254","amp;dn":"Blackadder%5C%27s+Christmas+Carol+%28Christmas+Special+1988%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75a7a1433afcaeb989d69a084615bd800ae27254","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,167,161,67,58,252,174,185,137,214,154,8,70,21,189,128,10,226,114,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
