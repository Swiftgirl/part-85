Jesus Christ, when asked if he was the son of God, in Matthew 26:64: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ According to the Christian Bible, the Jewish chief priests and elders and council deemed this statement by Jesus to be blasphemous, and they sentenced Jesus to death for saying it.\n\n2. Jesus Christ, talking to Jews about their God, in John 8:44: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYe are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ This is one of several chapters in the Christian Bible that can give a scriptural foundation to Christian anti-Semitism. The first part of John 8, the story of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwhoever is without sin cast the first stoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, was not in the original version, but was added centuries later. The original John 8 is a debate between Jesus and some Jews. In brief, Jesus calls the Jews who disbelieve him sons of the Devil, the Jews try to stone him, and Jesus runs away and hides.\n\n3. Muhammad, quoted in Hadith of Bukhari, Vol 1 Book 8 Hadith 427: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMay Allah curse the Jews and Christians for they built the places of worship at the graves of their prophets.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ This quote is attributed to Muhammad on his death-bed as a warning to Muslims not to copy this practice of the Jews and Christians. It is one of several passages in the Koran and in Hadith that can give a scriptural foundation to Islamic anti-Semitism, including the assertion in Sura 5:60 that Allah cursed Jews and turned some of them into apes and swine.\n\n4. Mark Twain, describing the Christian Bible in Letters from the Earth, 1909: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAlso it has another name ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Word of God. For the Christian thinks every word of it was dictated by God. It is full of interest. It has noble poetry in it; and some clever fables; and some blood-drenched history; and some good morals; and a wealth of obscenity; and upwards of a thousand liesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ But you notice that when the Lord God of Heaven and Earth, adored Father of Man, goes to war, there is no limit. He is totally without mercy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he, who is called the Fountain of Mercy. He slays, slays, slays! All the men, all the beasts, all the boys, all the babies; also all the women and all the girls, except those that have not been deflowered. He makes no distinction between innocent and guiltyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ What the insane Father required was blood and misery; he was indifferent as to who furnished it.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ TwainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s book was published posthumously in 1939. His daughter, Clara Clemens, at first objected to it being published, but later changed her mind in 1960 when she believed that public opinion had grown more tolerant of the expression of such ideas. That was half a century before Fianna Fail and the Green Party imposed a new blasphemy law on the people of Ireland.\n\n5. Tom Lehrer, The Vatican Rag, 1963: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGet in line in that processional, step into that small confessional. There, the guy whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s got religionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll tell you if your sinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s original. If it is, try playing it safer, drink the wine and chew the wafer. Two, four, six, eight, time to transubstantiate!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n6. Randy Newman, GodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Song, 1972: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAnd the Lord said: I burn down your cities ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ how blind you must be. I take from you your children, and you say how blessed are we. You all must be crazy to put your faith in me. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s why I love mankind.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n7. James Kirkup, The Love That Dares to Speak its Name, 1976: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhile they prepared the tomb I kept guard over him. His mother and the Magdalen had gone to fetch clean linen to shroud his nakedness. I was alone with himÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ I laid my lips around the tip of that great cock, the instrument of our salvation, our eternal joy. The shaft, still throbbed, anointed with deathÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s final ejaculation.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ This extract is from a poem that led to the last successful blasphemy prosecution in Britain, when Denis Lemon was given a suspended prison sentence after he published it in the now-defunct magazine Gay News. In 2002, a public reading of the poem, on the steps of St. Martin-in-the-Fields church in Trafalgar Square, failed to lead to any prosecution. In 2008, the British Parliament abolished the common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel.\n\n8. Matthias, son of Deuteronomy of Gath, in Monty PythonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Life of Brian, 1979: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLook, I had a lovely supper, and all I said to my wife was that piece of halibut was good enough for Jehovah.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n9. Rev Ian Paisley MEP to the Pope in the European Parliament, 1988: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI denounce you as the Antichrist.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ PaisleyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s website describes the Antichrist as being ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œa liar, the true son of the father of lies, the original liar from the beginningÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ he will imitate Christ, a diabolical imitation, Satan transformed into an angel of light, which will deceive the world.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n10. Conor Cruise OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Brien, 1989: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIn the last century the Arab thinker Jamal al-Afghani wrote: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Every Muslim is sick and his only remedy is in the Koran.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Unfortunately the sickness gets worse the more the remedy is taken.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n11. Frank Zappa, 1989: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIf you want to get together in any exclusive situation and have people love you, fine ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but to hang all this desperate sociology on the idea of The Cloud-Guy who has The Big Book, who knows if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been bad or good ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and cares about any of it ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ to hang it all on that, folks, is the chimpanzee part of the brain working.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n12. Salman Rushdie, 1990: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe idea of the sacred is quite simply one of the most conservative notions in any culture, because it seeks to turn other ideas ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ uncertainty, progress, change ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ into crimes.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ In 1989, Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran issued a fatwa ordering Muslims to kill Rushdie because of blasphemous passages in RushdieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s novel The Satanic Verses.\n\n13. Bjork, 1995: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI do not believe in religion, but if I had to choose one it would be Buddhism. It seems more livable, closer to menÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been reading about reincarnation, and the Buddhists say we come back as animals and they refer to them as lesser beings. Well, animals arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t lesser beings, theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re just like us. So I say fuck the Buddhists.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n14. Amanda Donohoe on her role in the Ken Russell movie Lair of the White Worm, 1995: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSpitting on Christ was a great deal of fun. I canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t embrace a male god who has persecuted female sexuality throughout the ages, and that persecution still goes on today all over the world.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n15. George Carlin, 1999: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œReligion easily has the greatest bullshit story ever told. Think about it. Religion has actually convinced people that thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an invisible man living in the sky who watches everything you do, every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a special list of ten things he does not want you to do. And if you do any of these ten things, he has a special place, full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish, where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry forever and ever ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢til the end of time! But He loves you. He loves you, and He needs money! He always needs money! HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s all-powerful, all-perfect, all-knowing, and all-wise, somehow just canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t handle money! Religion takes in billions of dollars, they pay no taxes, and they always need a little more. Now, talk about a good bullshit story. Holy Shit!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n16. Paul Woodfull as Ding Dong Denny OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Reilly, The Ballad of Jaysus Christ, 2000: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHe said me maÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a virgin and sure no one disagreed, Cause they knew a lad who walks on waterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s handy with his feetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Jaysus oh Jaysus, as cool as bleedinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ice, With all the scrubbers in Israel he could not be enticed, Jaysus oh Jaysus, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s funny you never rode, Cause itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s you I do be shoutinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ for each time I shoot me load.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n17. Jesus Christ, in Jerry Springer The Opera, 2003: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œActually, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m a bit gay.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ In 2005, the Christian Institute tried to bring a prosecution against the BBC for screening Jerry Springer the Opera, but the UK courts refused to issue a summons.\n\n18. Tim Minchin, Ten-foot Cock and a Few Hundred Virgins, 2005: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSo youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re gonna live in paradise, With a ten-foot cock and a few hundred virgins, So youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re gonna sacrifice your life, For a shot at the greener grass, And when the Lord comes down with his shiny rod of judgment, HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s gonna kick my heathen ass.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n19. Richard Dawkins in The God Delusion, 2006: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ In 2007 Turkish publisher Erol Karaaslan was charged with the crime of insulting believers for publishing a Turkish translation of The God Delusion. He was acquitted in 2008, but another charge was brought in 2009. Karaaslan told the court that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œit is a right to criticise religions and beliefs as part of the freedom of thought and expression.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n20. Pope Benedict XVI quoting a 14th century Byzantine emperor, 2006: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShow me just what Muhammad brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ This statement has already led to both outrage and condemnation of the outrage. The Organisation of the Islamic Conference, the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s largest Muslim body, said it was a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcharacter assassination of the prophet MuhammadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The Malaysian Prime Minister said that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe Pope must not take lightly the spread of outrage that has been created.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s foreign Ministry spokesperson said that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œanyone who describes Islam as a religion as intolerant encourages violenceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The European Commission said that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œreactions which are disproportionate and which are tantamount to rejecting freedom of speech are unacceptable.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n21. Christopher Hitchens in God is not Great, 2007: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThere is some question as to whether Islam is a separate religion at allÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Islam when examined is not much more than a rather obvious and ill-arranged set of plagiarisms, helping itself from earlier books and traditions as occasion appeared to requireÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ It makes immense claims for itself, invokes prostrate submission or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“surrenderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ as a maxim to its adherents, and demands deference and respect from nonbelievers into the bargain. There is nothingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½absolutely nothingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½in its teachings that can even begin to justify such arrogance and presumption.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n22. PZ Myers, on his desecration of a Roman Catholic communion host, 2008: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYou would not believe how many people are writing to me, insisting that these horrible little crackers (they look like flattened bits of styrofoam) are literally pieces of their god, and that this omnipotent being who created the universe can actually be seriously harmed by some third-rate liberal intellectual at a third-rate universityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ However, inspired by an old woodcut of Jews stabbing the host, I thought of a simple, quick thing to do: I pierced it with a rusty nail (I hope JesusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tetanus shots are up to date). And then I simply threw it in the trash, followed by the classic, decorative items of trash cans everywhere, old coffeegrounds and a banana peel.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n23. Ian OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Doherty, 2009: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ(If defamation of religion was illegal) it would be a crime for me to say that the notion of transubstantiation is so ridiculous that even a small child should be able to see the insanity and utter physical impossibility of a piece of bread and some wine somehow taking on corporeal form. It would be a crime for me to say that Islam is a backward desert superstition that has no place in modern, enlightened Europe and it would be a crime to point out that Jewish settlers in Israel who believe they have a God given right to take the land are, frankly, mad. All the above assertions will, no doubt, offend someone or other.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n24. Cardinal Cormac Murphy-OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Connor, 2009: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhether a person is atheist or any other, there is in fact in my view something not totally human if they leave out the transcendentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ we call it GodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ I think that if you leave that out you are not fully human.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Because atheism is not a religion, the Irish blasphemy law does not protect atheists from abusive and insulting statements about their fundamental beliefs. While atheists are not seeking such protection, we include the statement here to point out that it is discriminatory that this law does not hold all citizens equal.\n\n25. Dermot Ahern, Irish Minister for Justice, introducing his blasphemy law at an Oireachtas Justice Committee meeting, 2009, and referring to comments made about him personally: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThey are blasphemous.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Deputy Pat Rabbitte replied: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGiven the MinisterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s self-image, it could very well be that we are blaspheming,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and Minister Ahern replied: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDeputy Rabbitte says that I am close to the baby Jesus, I am so pure.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ So here we have an Irish Justice Minister joking about himself being blasphemed, at a parliamentary Justice Committee discussing his own blasphemy law, that could make his own jokes illegal.\n\nFinally, as a bonus, Micheal Martin, Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs, opposing attempts by Islamic States to make defamation of religion a crime at UN level, 2009: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWe believe that the concept of defamation of religion is not consistent with the promotion and protection of human rights. It can be used to justify arbitrary limitations on, or the denial of, freedom of expression. Indeed, Ireland considers that freedom of expression is a key and inherent element in the manifestation of freedom of thought and conscience and as such is complementary to freedom of religion or belief.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Just months after Minister Martin made this comment, his colleague Dermot Ahern introduced IrelandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s new blasphemy law.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:712b76c5c0655004bf765fec030b6c12e03e68c8","amp;dn":"Ronnie+Williams+-+The+Rational+Anthem+%28AKA+man+created+god%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"712b76c5c0655004bf765fec030b6c12e03e68c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,43,118,197,192,101,80,4,191,118,95,236,3,11,108,18,224,62,104,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
