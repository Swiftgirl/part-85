Hank, Sebastian's stepfather, drops a bomb: he announces he's having a sex change operation. Sebastian's sister leaves immediately for California, and his mother takes him back to England. Eight months later, Sebastian is back in New York, knocking on Hank's door. Hank (now Henrietta) takes Sebastian in and supports him over the next few months of high school. Sebastian's &quot;adventures&quot; are mostly self-destructive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b02d3ab85e0c2035d88d68bfcc98f302437c563f","amp;dn":"Adventures+of+Sebastian+Cole.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b02d3ab85e0c2035d88d68bfcc98f302437c563f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,45,58,184,94,12,32,53,216,141,104,191,204,152,243,2,67,124,86,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
