As a result the pictures leave a little to be desired, but the camera audio has been carefully replaced with a high-quality stereo recording taken from the soundboard. Some patches to the pictures have been inserted from an alternative audience-shot version from stage right and this second camera is also used for tracks 9, 11 &amp; 12 in the absence of the primary source. Produced in memory of Wojtek and brought to you from the nice people at Yellow Cow Records, with big thanks to IFWT (for sharing the video sources) and the tapers (for having the nuts to take a video camera to a gig).\n\n*The audio for 'Money' has a short patch from an audience source. 'One Of These Days' also has a very short audience-recorded audio patch.\n\nDisc One (available here:\n\nIntro\nAstronomy Domine\nLearning To Fly\nWhat Do You Want From Me\nOn The Turning Away\nTake It Back\nA Great Day For Freedom\nSorrow\nKeep Talking\nOne Of These Days\nShine On You Crazy Diamond\n\nDisc Two (this torrent);\n\nBreathe\nTime\nBreathe Reprise\nHigh Hopes\nThe Great Gig In The Sky\nWish You Were Here\nUs And Them\nMoney\nAnother Brick In The Wall\nComfortably Numb\nHey You\nRun Like Hell\n\nHave fun and share freely!\n\nrou x","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d35ae2c7b567e07e491220514916c84a61f4e7e","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+-+POLSO+%28Turin+94%29+%5BYellow+Cow+DVD%5D+DISC+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d35ae2c7b567e07e491220514916c84a61f4e7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,53,174,44,123,86,126,7,228,145,34,5,20,145,108,132,166,31,78,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
