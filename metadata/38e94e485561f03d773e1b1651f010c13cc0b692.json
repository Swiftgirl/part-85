But unfortunately, most of the CD fell short of &quot;Unbelievable&quot;'s excellence. \nThis isn't to say that Schubert Dip is a bad album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ far from it, in fact. But weighed against &quot;Unbelievable&quot;'s dizzying infectiousness, distinctly British dance/rock/pop offerings like &quot;Girl of an Age,&quot; &quot;Children,&quot; and the follow-up single &quot;Lies&quot; are fairly catchy, but nonetheless mildly disappointing. The only song that comes close to packing the punch of &quot;Unbelievable&quot; is the intoxicating &quot;Long Summer Days.&quot; \nFor the most part, Schubert Dip is a prime example of an album that is simply decent when it should have been excellent.
