It was released in October 1993, and entered the Billboard Top Pop Albums chart on December 25, 1993. The album was the first album recorded by the Wilson sisters after the group Wilson Phillips went on hiatus.\n\nThe album was not a commercial success, peaking at #116 on the Billboard Top Pop Albums chart, and reaching #25 on the Top Holiday Albums chart. The track listing for the album consists of eleven Christmas standards, plus the original title track, Hey Santa, written by Jack Kugell and Carnie &amp; Wendy Wilson.\n\nThe title track is about how a man returning home to his love on Christmas, after his love wished that Santa would &quot;bring [her] baby home tonight.&quot; SBK Records released one single to radio and retail. Hey Santa, backed with Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, was issued on cassette single and on a green vinyl 45rpm, SBK S7-17648-A, and reached #22 on the Billboard Top Adult Contemporary chart. It also reached #1 on the Billboard Bubbling Under the Hot 100 chart, often shown as #101 on the Hot 100 in Billboard reference books. The single still receives recurrent airplay during the Christmas holiday season. Carl Wilson, Carnie &amp; Wendy's Uncle and a Beach Boy founding member, features prominently in the backing vocal.\n\nThe album also features a Wilson family recording from 1977 of I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus that features the Beach Boys on backing vocals and a wide range of Beach Boys band members' children, including Matthew &amp; Adam Jardine, Hailey &amp; Christian Love, and Jonah &amp; Justyn Wilson.\n\nHey Santa was later reissued with the same content and a two-page booklet without lyrics in 1999 with the catalog number 98289 by EMI/Capitol Special Markets on both CD and cassette. As of November, 2007, this version of Hey Santa is still available. In 2007, Carnie Wilson released a solo Christmas album, Christmas With Carnie, that features new versions of many of the same songs.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97125a42aee1cddd24380124b5a8e8f039247537","amp;dn":"Carnie+%26+Wendy+Wilson+-+Hey+Santa++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97125a42aee1cddd24380124b5a8e8f039247537","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,18,90,66,174,225,205,221,36,56,1,36,181,168,232,240,57,36,117,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
