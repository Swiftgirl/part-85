Samrat (Rohit Roy) is a successful Bengali pop musician who discovers the talented Paromita (Reshmi Ghosh) in Shillong. He brings Paromita to Kolkata, hoping her voice will captivate city audiences and the two fall in love.\n\nHowever, their happily-ever-after is still out of reach. ParomitaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unwillingness to follow current music trends leads her back to Shillong where she becomes a recluse. In the meantime, SamratÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s music begins to suffer.\n\nEnter Rai (Gauri Karnik), whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s flown in all the way from New York to become the third corner of this love triangle. As expected, she too falls for Samrat and tries to help him regain his former glory. But Samrat canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get Paromita out of his mind. As the film progresses, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s revealed that the pasts of the two leading ladies are connected, which leads to further complexities.\n\nWith popular TV actors Rohit Roy and Reshmi Ghosh in the lead, and Gauri Karnik on screen after a long time, DharÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s film boasts of an offbeat cast.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f99deedcb4ec2a7882230c0321e44f2af763d00","amp;dn":"%5BThek%5D+Pa+Ma+Ga+Re+Sa+%5B2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f99deedcb4ec2a7882230c0321e44f2af763d00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,153,222,237,203,78,194,167,136,34,48,192,50,30,68,242,175,118,61,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
