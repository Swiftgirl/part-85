These tutorials provide an easy step-by-step method of learning the product and the workflow necessary to complete most common tasks.\n\nInstructions:\nExtract after downloading, read the README file\nIMPORTANT NOTE: For Vista/Windows 7 users, run the keygen and the installation as an Administrator user.\nEven if you're on an Administrator account, you have to run the program and keygen as an Administrator. How? By right clicking on the said program, click &quot;Run as..&quot; or &quot;Run as administrator&quot; in Windows 7, select an Administrator account, type the password if required, click &quot;Ok&quot;\nPlease download the version that is meant for your OS, meaning Windows 64 bit should use Vegas 64 bit, same with 32 bit. There is a problem currently with the keygen not being able to register Vegas 32 bit onto a Windows 64 bit environment.\nFOR EVERYONE - You must copy the activation code correctly, it is not just what you see, highlight the code to the end. There are 6 groups of 9 characters, if the activation code still fails, delete the registry keys again, re-run the program and keygen. Generate a different key and try again.\nTry patching the program again if it still doesn't accept the key and re-enter the serial and activation code. The serial and activation code are in pairs, meaning you can't click generate again and use a different activation code for the previous serial.\nSome common mistakes that people make are:\n1. Not running the keygen and Sony installation file as an Administrator account\n2. The keygen is set on default, meaning the Sony Vegas option isn't selected from the drop-down box in the keygen.\n3. The keygen isn't placed in the Sony folder or isn't directed to the right directory to patch. \n\nFor those who can't get the keygen to work, perhaps this will help:\n\nHow to make Sony keygens work\nI was having problems getting the Sony products keygen to work with ACID 7.0 recently, and I noticed that when I got to the point where I was registering the product &quot;by phone&quot;, the Machine ID shown in the keygen wasn't matching up with the Machine ID shown in the application registration program (which showed the ID to have an extra two digits, &quot;-XX&quot;).\n\nAs I normally would when encountering a software problem, I looked around for other people's answers to people with the same problem. I did find a lot of people with the same or similar problems (apparently a lot of people are having the same problem with Sonay Vegas and the like), but I couldn't find a solution anywhere.\n\nSo, after much hassle, I came up with this solution, which amazed me in its simplicity.\n\nI have so far only tried this on ACID, but I am sure that it would work with other Sony products assuming that that the problem is to do with the Machine ID. However I can't guarantee it. Let me know if it works for you.\n\nSo, here's what I did:\n\n\nIf you've already attempted to use a serial key, you'll probably have to remove it first because it won't match up. You can do this by going to Start &gt; Run and running regedit, then navigating to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Sony Creative Software/ACID Pro/7.0/Licence and deleting the values for key1 and CurrentKey.\n\nNow you are ready to follow these steps:\n\n1. Download and install the Resource Tuner 30-day trial (sorry I can't provide a full download, but it doesn't really matter. If someone else can provide a full version that would be fantastic), available here:\n[Select All] &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.restuner.com/download.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.restuner.com/download.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n2. Open Resource Tuner and use it to navigate to the place you installed your Sony product (I'm in C:Program FilesSonyACID Pro 7.0). From there use it to open ApplicationRegistration.exe.\n\n3. Once you've clicked continue to get rid of the dialog box telling you to buy the product or whatever, expand the folder labelled Dialog and find the entry that has the heading &quot;Online Registration Error - Register Over the Phone&quot;\n\n4 Double-click on the number of that resource in the tree view under Dialog (the one on the left - for me the one numbered 7003) to open up Resource Tuner's Resource Editor.\n\n5. Click on the first item of the list on the left and use the arrow keys to scroll down through each item. Keep an eye on the Caption of the item.\n\n6. When you reach one that has the caption &quot;Computer ID:&quot;, scroll down one more. The preview image should be selecting an invisible box to the right of the Computer ID text.\n\n7. Now look at the list just below the Caption (which should be blank for this, by the way), and uncheck the box labelled es_readonly.\n\n8. Click OK, then Yes, then save the file. You should make a backup of the original, but I believe the program also makes a backup automatically.\n\n9. Run your keygen, and then run your Sony product. Follow the usual steps to get to the &quot;Register Over the Phone&quot; dialog box. You should now be able to simply edit the Machine ID to match the one shown in your keygen.\n\n10. Copy in your activation code, and your program should work! God damn, I was surprised when THAT happened.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d51ba59dc41c1a049e0ea4aab91bcb9e1e5e025f","amp;dn":"Sony+Vegas+Pro+9.0abc+x32bit+NEWEST%2BKeygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d51ba59dc41c1a049e0ea4aab91bcb9e1e5e025f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,27,165,157,196,28,26,4,158,14,164,170,185,27,203,158,30,94,2,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
