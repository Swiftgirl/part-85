Plus, two fantastic\nremixes by my favourite remix artist, Diplo, one of which has been making\nthe rounds on the music blogs lately (for very good reason). \n\nI'd like to apologize in advance for putting &quot;Haiti&quot; by Arcade Fire on\nthis month's playlist -- shamelessly topical, but also a genuinely great\nsong. Everyone likes Arcade Fire, right? They must.\n\nAlso, Valentine's Day is coming up... hope you have a good one!\n\nCheers,\n\nJosh\n\nP.S.: Thanks to the people who introduced me to Givers, Just Jack, Miami\nHorror, The Presets and all the other artists I couldn't fit on this\nmonth's playlist!\n\nKnow of a song or artist that deserves to be in a future CTC Playlist?\nLet me know here: http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dGlzY1d0elJwNUg4UFpEcTg0cVBOZlE6MA\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\n\ncut the crap playlists: a fresh batch of genre- and border-crossing\ntracks every month. good music, for free, monthly. it doesn't have to be\nnew... it just has to be good!\n\nbuying music and attending concerts is worth your money -- please do it!\n\nfind out about new ctc playlists first at the ONLY official ctc website:\nhttp://mindset.tumblr.com\n_________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nTracklisting:\n`````````````\n\n* = NEW!
