Another &quot;big push&quot; is planned, and Captain Blackadder's one goal is to avoid getting shot, so he plots ways to get out of it. Blackadder is joined by his batman Private S. Baldrick (Tony Robinson) and idealistic Edwardian twit Lieutenant George (Hugh Laurie). General Melchett (Stephen Fry) rallies his troops from a French mansion thirty-five miles from the front, where he is aided and abetted by his assistant, Captain Darling (Tim McInnerny), pencil-pusher supreme and Blackadder's nemesis, whose name is played on for maximum comedy value.\n\nSeason/series 4: 6 episodes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27ba9da8eafa622e558e9074adc8dcdb85ebb821","amp;dn":"Blackadder+Goes+Forth+%28Fourth+series%2C+1989%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27ba9da8eafa622e558e9074adc8dcdb85ebb821","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,186,157,168,234,250,98,46,85,142,144,116,173,200,220,219,133,235,184,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
