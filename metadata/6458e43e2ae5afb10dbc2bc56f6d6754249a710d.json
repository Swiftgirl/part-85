He launched a solo career after the dissolution of that band. In recent years, he has cultivated a more independent-minded approach, primarily recording his music at home in his basement.\n\nFolker is Paul Westerberg's sixth solo album. It peaked at number 178 on the Billboard 200 and number 18 on the Top Independent Album charts.\n\nFolker marks the final chapter in a trilogy of albums for the previous leader of The Replacements, which started back in 2002 with the release of the double album Stereo/Mono. Much like that set, Folker was entirely written, produced and recorded by Westerberg in his basement studio, with the recording kept as simple and lo-fi as possible. Westerberg has stated in interviews that he wanted to create a folk album in the vein of Rod Stewart's earliest solo work, consisting of an acoustic base with minimal instrumentation layered on top of the tracks.\n\nWesterberg shopped &quot;Jingle&quot; around to major retailers like Target and Best Buy for use in advertising, but they passed\n\n Track listing\nAll songs by Paul Westerberg.\n\n&quot;Jingle&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:28 \n&quot;Now I Wonder&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:35 \n&quot;My Dad&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:28 \n&quot;Lookin' Up in Heaven&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:12 \n&quot;Anyway's All Right&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:41 \n&quot;$100 Groom&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:15 \n&quot;23 Years Ago&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:35 \n&quot;As Far as I Know&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:03 \n&quot;What About Mine?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:43 \n&quot;How Can You Like Him?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:04 \n&quot;Breathe Some New Life&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:30 \n&quot;Gun Shy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:14 \n&quot;Folk Star&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:17 \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6458e43e2ae5afb10dbc2bc56f6d6754249a710d","amp;dn":"Paul+Westerberg...Folker%282004%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6458e43e2ae5afb10dbc2bc56f6d6754249a710d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,88,228,62,42,229,175,177,13,188,43,197,111,109,103,84,36,154,113,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
