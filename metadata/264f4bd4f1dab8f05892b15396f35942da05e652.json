We're still not quite sure if there is any more to follow.\n\n\nCast:\nPatrick Barlow]\nJohn Ramm\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/national_theatre_brent_icons/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/national_theatre_brent_icons/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe National Theatre Of Brent's Iconic Icons - S01 - E01 - Bob Dylan\n.\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration        : 28mn 1s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:264f4bd4f1dab8f05892b15396f35942da05e652","amp;dn":"The+National+Theatre+Of+Brents+Iconic+Icons+-+Audio+Comedy+-+Mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"264f4bd4f1dab8f05892b15396f35942da05e652","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,79,75,212,241,218,184,240,88,146,177,83,150,243,89,66,218,5,230,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
