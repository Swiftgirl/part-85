Ben has survived a crippling brain lesion but he won't engage with the world around him, preferring to stay safely in his own fantasy world.\n\n\nwww.comedy.org.uk Review\n[quote]A dark radio comedy about a man recovering from a coma.\n\nIn Series 1 and Series 2, Ben doesn't get out much... because he's in a coma. However, he does have an active imagination, a comfortable bed and his mum and wife at his side.\n\nThe 2009 special sees Ben spending time in a rehabilitation unit as he learns to speak and move again.\n\nIn the third series sees Ben, a newly disabled man, return home. People see Ben differently and he starts to see them differently, too.\n\nVent is an original comedy about how a life-threatening illness can change peoples lives. It is based on the writer's own experiences (in 2001 Nigel Smith was rushed to hospital with a brain lesion so big the radiologist thought the scan had been taken post-mortem - he has written about this in more detail in his best selling book).[quote]\n\n\nCast:\nBen ......
