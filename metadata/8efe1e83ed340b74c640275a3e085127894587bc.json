The band rebounded by recruiting vocalist Brian Johnson (a Scott favorite) and releasing their best-selling album ever, BACK IN BLACK. BONFIRE is a five-disc tribute to the pugnacious and raspy-voiced Scott, overflowing with the bare-fisted riffs and ribald lyrics that were the trademark of his edition of the band. Recorded live at New York's Atlantic Studios, Disc 1 was originally a promotional-only release that's been bootlegged countless times over the years. All thriller, no filler, this recording overflows with plenty of classics ranging from the band's cheeky tribute to venereal disease (&quot;The Clap&quot;) to the tale of an over-sexed Rubenesque female fan (&quot;Whole Lotta Rosie.&quot;)\n\nDiscs Two and Three are an expanded version of the soundtrack to the 1980 concert film &quot;Let There Be Rock.&quot; Recorded before a French audience, AC/DC's in-your-face performance transcended any cultural differences and the audience often sang along despite language barriers. Entitled VOLTS, Disc Four consists of work-in-process studio recordings of material such as &quot;Touch Too Much&quot; and &quot;Get It Hot&quot; with different lyrics than the finished versions. The inclusion of the slow blues of &quot;Ride On&quot; shows another side to AC/DC often lost among the lascivious offerings of &quot;Beatin' Around The Bush&quot; and &quot;She's Got Balls.&quot; A re-mastered version of BACK IN BLACK completes this set marking the end of one era and the beginning of another.\n\nIncludes liner notes by Murray Engleheart.\n\nAC/DC: Bon Scott, Brian Johnson (vocals); Angus Young, Malcolm Young (guitar); Cliff Williams (bass); Phil Rudd (drums).\n\nProducers include: Harry Vanda, George Young, Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange.\n\n5cdsSpin (2/98, p.104) - 7 (out of 10) - &quot;...This is dance music for boys who claim they hate dance music....Ultimately, what you hear on BONFIRE is the link between mainstream metal, disco, and punk self-destruction, a formula that has obviously been studied by such beat-intensive bands as Guns N' Roses and Prodigy...&quot;\nEntertainment Weekly (12/12/97, p.84) - &quot;...Though BONFIRE could have been titled VARIATIONS ON FOUR CHORDS, it's as down and dirty as rock gets.&quot;\n- Rating: B\nQ (12/03, p.148) - 4 stars out of 5 - &quot;...[A] handsome treasure trove of novelty demos, the whole of 1980's Back In Black album, plus three live discs reprising the derailing freight train sound of the band in concert...&quot;\nNME (Magazine) (12/13/97, p.38) - 8 (out of 10) - &quot;...BONFIRE...is raw, hoarse and flawed, but it's AC/DC in flame.
