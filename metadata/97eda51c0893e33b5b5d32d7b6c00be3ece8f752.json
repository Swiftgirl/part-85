A time of classic kids flicks,                \n          painstaking hand-drawn animation and countless             \n             cheesy low-budget horrors. A time when pop had             \n              a King, and rock had a Queen. A time when special\n              FX wizards ruled, and CGI was just one of their\n              many tools.\n\n                Driven by nostalgia and memories of better\n              days, we seek to relive those times, and share\n              those memories. While our belief is that the\n              80s represent the very pinnacle of pop culture,\n              we will not limit ourselves to one decade, or\n              any single genre. We will not ignore the movies\n              considered insignificant or even embarrassing by\n              the studios. We will not disregard a timepiece\n              just because it is dated.\n\n                Whereas most groups rely solely on digital\n              sources, there are still thousands of rare and\n              out of print titles, many of which have no\n              planned digital release. We've made it our\n              mission to dig these out, clean them up using\n              the best hardware and techniques available to\n              us, and share them with the world. Be it VHS,\n              Laserdisc or more exotic formats, we're here\n              to bring you the best (and worst!) of decades\n           past. So sit back and enjoy as we uncover and             \n           pay tribute to an age of cinema we will never           \n         get back.                                               \n                                                                     \n                                                               \n                                                     \n                                     \n                                                 \n                                                 \n                           -+  Respect  +-                  \n                                                            \n                                                                \n                 AEN  AEROHOLiCS  ALLiANCE  ARTHOUSE            \n                                                                \n                BLooDWeiSeR  EPiC  EPiSODE  FiCO  FLS           \n                                                                \n              FRAGMENT  HkM  HUMANiSM  KYR  MEMETiC  QiX        \n                                                                 \n                SAPHiRE  TheWretched  VH-PROD  VoMiT  xV         \n                                                                 \n                                                                 \n                Gone But Not Forgotten       \n                                                                 \n                 SiCK  Cheetah-TV  CuNT  BlooDLiTE  TCF          \n                                                                 \n                                                                 \n                   and everyone who truly contributes            \n                                                                 \n                                                              \n       \n                                             \n                  ascii: asphyx!LGF!CPH!SAC!ACiD 2002","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97eda51c0893e33b5b5d32d7b6c00be3ece8f752","amp;dn":"Brain.Smasher.A.Love.Story.1993.STV.DVDRip.XviD-FLAiR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97eda51c0893e33b5b5d32d7b6c00be3ece8f752","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,237,165,28,8,147,227,59,91,93,50,215,182,192,11,227,236,232,247,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
