After her murder, she lives in the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œin betweenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and watches her family adjust to her being gone and tries to help them find her killer.\n\nInput: The.Lovely.Bones.2009.DVDSCR.XviD-Lynks-PrisM  1.32GB\n\n*** Small-sized 2-pass re-encode of DVDSCR for computers (PC, Mac), PS3 or Xbox, portable and mobile devices (Ipod, Itouch) . ***\n*** Video is 480x272 H264; audio is 44.1 kHz/stereo AAC LC and container is MP4. ***\n\nI can recommend CoreCodec for H264 (avc1, x264) video-playback, free DivX 7 for AAC sound-playback (and .mkv with AAC), Haali splitter (free, comes with CoreCodec) as the fastest and best combination for Windows Media Player. This is what I use.\nVLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.\nOne can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.\nQuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.\nPS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV has been reported as best combination.\nAnd please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, took proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).\nMany of movies I encode have embedded subtitles. So far, only VLC player is able to use them correctly.\n\nUSE TORRENT-SEARCH SITES, TorrentBar extension for FireFox OR EVEN GOOGLE: show-name H264\n(for example GOSSIP GIRL H264).\n\n&quot;Home&quot; of my torrents (for Bookmark/Favorites in your browser) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty&lt;/a&gt;\n\nInteresting &quot;Discussion&quot; to follow: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5191311/Cloudy.With.A.Chance.Of.Meatballs.PROPER.H264&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5191311/Cloudy.With.A.Chance.Of.Meatballs.PROPER.H264&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5190694/The.Bad.Lieutenant.Port.of.Call.New.Orleans.LIMITED.H264&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5190694/The.Bad.Lieutenant.Port.of.Call.New.Orleans.LIMITED.H264&lt;/a&gt;\nYour comments and opinions are welcomed, good and the bad ones.\n\nNOTE: It was bad input, I'm sorry, video-quality is lower than usual. It would be nice if the guys who have encoded this DVDSCR gave more bytes to the picture and re-encoded the sound in more common mp3 format than 5.1 AC3 what had direct consequences in excessive file-size. Well, beware, this is &quot;only&quot; a screener...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:073d8bc13d47b454485daae9381f0ade82d09e34","amp;dn":"The.Lovely.Bones.2009.DVDSCR.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"073d8bc13d47b454485daae9381f0ade82d09e34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,61,139,193,61,71,180,84,72,93,170,233,56,31,10,222,130,208,158,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
