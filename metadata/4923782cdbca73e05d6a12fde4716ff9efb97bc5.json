He is probably best known for the children's cartoon series Roobarb (1974), Noah and Nelly in... SkylArk (1977) and Henry's Cat (1983) and for the Trio chocolate biscuit advertisements shown in the UK during the early 1980s. However, he has also produced a BAFTA and Academy award-winning short film Great (1976), a tongue-in-cheek biography of Isambard Kingdom Brunel. He was previously nominated for a Academy Award for his film Kama Sutra Rides Again which was screened with the UK release of Stanley Kubrick's film A Clockwork Orange. \n\nFurther Academy Awards nominations were received for Dream Doll (1980), with Zlatko Grgic, and Small Talk (1994).\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Godfrey&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.toonhound.com/bobgodfrey.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.toonhound.com/bobgodfrey.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079079/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079079/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n*** PLEASE NOTE ***\n\nCertification: UK:X \n(TAKEN FROM IMDB)\n\n\n.................                                      ..................\n.................*** PLEASE HELP TO SEED IF YOU CAN ***..................\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4923782cdbca73e05d6a12fde4716ff9efb97bc5","amp;dn":"DREAM+DOLL+-+Bob+Godfrey+animation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4923782cdbca73e05d6a12fde4716ff9efb97bc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,35,120,44,219,202,115,224,93,106,18,253,228,113,111,249,239,185,123,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
