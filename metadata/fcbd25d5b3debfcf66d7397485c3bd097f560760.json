Keiser is the host of On the Edge, a program of news and analysis hosted by Iran's Press TV, and he also hosts Keiser Report, a financial tabloid, that broadcasts on Russia Today. Keiser correctly predicted the sub-prime mortgage-backed securities crisis would result in recession and also predicted the break-down of Iceland's economy in 2008.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://maxkeiser.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://maxkeiser.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Keiser&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Keiser&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/max-keiser&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/max-keiser&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nAlex covers the latest breaking news and takes your calls.\n\n[Webster Tarpley visits in the later part of hour 4 to talk about the history of &quot;patsies.&quot;]\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
