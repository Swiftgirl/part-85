Requires SetupS.\n\nDescription: It is the unimaginably distant year 2009. You are Nick Vrenna, falsely locked inside a high security prison. The genetic experiments conducted in the prison, combined with a full-scale riot that took place recently, caused all guards and inmates to be transformed into insane, aggressive mutants. Your job is to escape while stopping the genetic plague from transforming the whole world.\n\nAbuse is a side-scrolling platformer with a lot of shooting. It's a nonlinear game, as the levels often have a few exits that lead to different areas. Your character is a cyborg equipped with various weapons; initially, you only have a weak laser rifle with unlimited ammo, but you can find more powerful guns later on, such as grenade launchers, flamethrowers or lightsabers. You move through a building complex, fighting any enemies you might encounter on the way. The enemies are mostly the mutants, but also the defense systems (such as stationary missile launchers).\n\nResembling a side-scrolling platform game, the game is marked for its unusual control scheme: While you move with the keyboard, you can aim with your mouse, so you can shoot at any angle no matter what direction you are running. On your way, you'll find elevators, teleporters, cracked walls that can be destroyed and more.\n\nOriginally a DOS run and gun video game developed by CrackCom in 1996, the game's source code has been in the public domain since the late 1990s, along with some of the Shareware content. There are now ports for Linux, Mac OS, Acorn Archimedes, and AmigaOS 4. The game has even been ported to the iPhone/iPod Touch platform.\n\nThe port included in this pack is the 32-bit SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer library) distro. Hence, Abuse-SDL has the following extra features over the original Abuse:\n\n- Run at any screen depth from 8bpp to 32bpp.\n- Run fullscreen or in a window.\n- Software and OpenGL hardware accelerated scaling.\n- Lock the mouse to the window.\n- Mousewheel support for changing weapons.\n- Stereo sound.\n\n MD5: b1a39cbabe3ff2024d924bb4b0900392\n______________________________________________________________________\n\n'Built on LT technology' ...
