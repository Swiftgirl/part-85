Featured guests on the album include Justin Timberlake, Ludacris, Chris Brown, Young Jeezy, The-Dream, Missy Elliott and T-Pain. In the US, the album debuted and peaked at number 3 on the Billboard 200. Internationally, the album charted in the top 10 in the UK &amp; Ireland. The album's first single in the US is R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Charts top ten hit &quot;Never Ever&quot;, featuring Young Jeezy. The international lead single and US second single is the worldwide hit &quot;Love Sex Magic&quot;, with Justin Timberlake which would later go on to receive a nomination for Best Choreography at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. The album's third single &quot;Like A Surgeon&quot; reached 59 on the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop chart without an official release date, whilst the final single &quot;Work&quot; was released in international markets reaching top 40 in Ireland and Sweden but only 52 in the UK before being pulled from radios.\nFantasy Ride also introduces Ciara's comic book character, &quot;Super C&quot;. Ciara said that Super C is her &quot;inner strength and aggressive persona&quot;. The Super C character is set to become a major factor in Fantasy Ride promotion. She is a futuristic, superhero-esque Ciara, loosely based on the robotic character Ciara portrayed in the &quot;Go Girl&quot; music video. DC Comics artist Bernard Chang helped Ciara create the character for the album artwork. Ciara said she worked on the artwork about nine months to a year.[13] On April 5, her official website posted the new album covers (purple Super C for the standard edition, red Super C for the deluxe edition). Speaking on the images, Ciara stated, &quot;Super C&quot; is my super hero name. It's who I am. It's the inner strength and drive that enables me to overcome any obstacles and who I have to be in order to accomplish my dreams and survive in this tough world.&quot; Her official website confirmed that in North America the album will feature the super hero covers whereas international markets will receive the human cover featuring Ciara on a faded white background.\n\t\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Ciara To The Stage\n[02] Love Sex Magic\t\t-ÃƒÂ¯Ã†â€™Ã‚Â  Featuring Justin Timberlake\n[03] High Price \t\t\t-ÃƒÂ¯Ã†â€™Ã‚Â  Featuring Ludacris\n[04] Turntables\t\t\t-ÃƒÂ¯Ã†â€™Ã‚Â  Featuring Chris Brown\n[05] Like A Surgeon\n[06] Never Ever\t\t\t-ÃƒÂ¯Ã†â€™Ã‚Â  Featuring Young Jeezy\n[07] Lover's Thing \t\t-ÃƒÂ¯Ã†â€™Ã‚Â  Featuring The-Dream\n[08] Work \t\t\t-ÃƒÂ¯Ã†â€™Ã‚Â  Featuring Missy Elliott\n[09] Pucker Up\n[10] G Is For Girl (A-Z)\n[11] Keep Dancin' On Me\n[12] Tell Me What Your Name Is\n[13] I Don't Remember\n[14] Echo\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t-ÃƒÂ¯Ã†â€™Ã‚Â  00h:54m:36s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t-ÃƒÂ¯Ã†â€™Ã‚Â  139mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t-ÃƒÂ¯Ã†â€™Ã‚Â  320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t-ÃƒÂ¯Ã†â€™Ã‚Â  I-Tunes v9.0.0.70 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic video Format \t-ÃƒÂ¯Ã†â€™Ã‚Â  N / A\n\t\nScanned Artwork\t\t-ÃƒÂ¯Ã†â€™Ã‚Â  Yes @ 300dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t-ÃƒÂ¯Ã†â€™Ã‚Â  Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t-ÃƒÂ¯Ã†â€™Ã‚Â  Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t-ÃƒÂ¯Ã†â€™Ã‚Â  33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t-ÃƒÂ¯Ã†â€™Ã‚Â  R&amp;B Pop\n\nOriginally Released\t-ÃƒÂ¯Ã†â€™Ã‚Â  03 May 2009 [UK] 05 May 2009 [US] 08 May 2009 [World Wide]\n\nRecord Company\t\t-ÃƒÂ¯Ã†â€™Ã‚Â  LeFace Records Sony Music\n\nArtist Website             -ÃƒÂ¯Ã†â€™Ã‚Â  http://www.ciaraworld.com \n                           -ÃƒÂ¯Ã†â€™Ã‚Â  http://www.azlyrics.com/c/ciara.html \n                           -ÃƒÂ¯Ã†â€™Ã‚Â  http://twitter.com/CIara \n                           -ÃƒÂ¯Ã†â€™Ã‚Â  http://www.bebo.com/ciara \n                           -ÃƒÂ¯Ã†â€™Ã‚Â  http://www.ilike.com/artist/Ciara \n                           -ÃƒÂ¯Ã†â€™Ã‚Â  http://www.muzu.tv/ciara \n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75a9a8dccd00d0a5fd718cd6c5573639973e539a","amp;dn":"%5B2009%5D+Fantasy+Ride+-+Ciara+-+131mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75a9a8dccd00d0a5fd718cd6c5573639973e539a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,169,168,220,205,0,208,165,253,113,140,214,197,87,54,57,151,62,83,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
