Take control of the crusade, creating devastating weapons from everyday items and teaming up with other sentient plant forms that'll leave the enemy sliced and diced. Let the stylus be your rapier and the Wii Remote your bazooka as you cut down the multitude of household pests that threaten our very existence! Mushroom Men inhabit the world that goes on while we humans are looking the other way, in the twilight hours when we sleep. We tower above them and go about our business completely unaware of the war waged at our feet. After the comet had passed, the scientists concluded that the strange, green dust had no effect on the world. No one noticed that tiny plants and fungi were acting strangely. Mushrooms, cacti, flowers and vines had awakened to full consciousness. Tribes quickly formed, building plant and fungi nations and with nation buildingÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ came war! Mushroom Men shows gamers the mundane world from the surreal perspective of a three inch high Mushroom Man. As a brave Bolete Mushroom, players can wreak havoc on their enemies by transforming common household trinkets and trash into weapons and tools.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afde7310f0e03fd26be314427920030485547a44","amp;dn":"Mushroom+Men+The+Spore+Wars+%5BPAL%5D+%5BWiiTorrentZ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afde7310f0e03fd26be314427920030485547a44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,222,115,16,240,224,63,210,107,227,20,66,121,32,3,4,133,84,122,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
