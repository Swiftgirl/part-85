He travels back in time to find hippos roaming through Trafalgar Square, an immense forest that spreads from Land's End to John O'Groats, and prehistoric reptiles swimming in Britain's tropical seas.\nIn an inspiring and compelling series, Alan shoes how the British landscape and wildlife have evolved through dramatic geological, climatic and human change, but he also examines the state of the land today and investigates the fresh challenges and responsibilities we face in a future that promises as many spectacular transformations as in the past. \nPresented by Alan Titchmarsch, this DVD peels back the years and takes us on a remarkable journey through history. Far from the climate we know today, 'British Isles - A Natural History' reveals the swamps, rainforests, ice ages and volcanos, alongside the civilisations and revolutions that shaped the familiar face of the British Isles.\n\n1: 3 Billion Years in the Making\n2: Dinosaurs, Deserts and Volcanoes\n3: Ice Age\n4: Islands Apart\n5: Taming the Wild\n6: Revolution\n7: Modern Times\n8: Our Future \n\n\nAudio: Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo \nAspect Ratio: 16:9 Enhanced \nTransfer Format: Widescreen\nVideo Encoding: Xvid\nAudio Encoding: MP3 128kbps\nCategory: Documentary ABC/BBC  \nFormat: PAL DVD\nRating: G \nLanguages: English  \nSubtitles: None  \nRunning Time: 240 mins \n\nRipped, Encoded &amp; Shared by Smelly-Cat\n\n \nAs always...if you like what you receive, leave a comment &amp; please seed.\nAfter you have completed the download, please seed until until you reach a share ratio of 1.0 or greater.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62f8d51b415b0391276e93fd1fffd2bc093f75ad","amp;dn":"BBC-British+Isles%3A+A+Natural+History%5B2004%5DDVDrip%5Beng%5D+Smelly-Cat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62f8d51b415b0391276e93fd1fffd2bc093f75ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,248,213,27,65,91,3,145,39,110,147,253,31,255,210,188,9,63,117,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
