It was produced by Tore Johansson who last worked with The Cardigans on Gran Turismo and since then with the band Franz Ferdinand. The album was released in Germany and Ireland on October 14, 2005 and in the UK on October 17, 2005. A Japanese edition has since been released. The first single released was &quot;I Need Some Fine Wine and You, You Need to Be Nicer&quot;. The second single was &quot;Don't Blame Your Daughter (Diamonds).&quot; It was said that &quot;Godspell&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the lyrics of which reference a conservative religious mentality common to the band's hometown of JÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶nkÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶pingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ was to be the third single, but plans for its release fell through.\n\t\nAmazon.com Review By Matthew Cooke - Sweden's the Cardigans broke big in America in 1996 with First Band on the Moon and the hit &quot;Lovefool.&quot; A slippery, slick pop tune, the song was also unmistakably twisted, as vocalist Nina Persson described a desperate, submissive affair in honey-flecked tones and happy-day hooks. The dichotomy was a neat little joke that went right over a lot of merrily nodding heads. A decade later on Super Extra Gravity, the band still likes to play with expectations of what a pop band is supposed to be. But while the melodic camouflage for Persson's dour lyrics once made for an effective disguise, Gravity struggles to maintain the illusion. The music here is self-consciously ambitious, constantly reshuffling and losing its momentum, leaving Persson in charge of connecting each song's too-disparate parts. It's a task for which her Chrissie-Hynde-meets-Harriet-Wheeler voice is not well-suited. &quot;Drip Drop Teardrop,&quot; for instance, needs either a belter to accentuate the song's jagged edges or a chanteuse to smooth it out, and Persson can do neither. There are pieces of songs that still rope us in. The chorus of &quot;Little Black Cloud,&quot; for instance, generates an exuberant energy that matches Persson's tale of a girl spinning and dancing her way toward a vaguely sinister conclusion, while &quot;In the Round&quot; mines an appealingly sparse and slow guitar drawl. However, the pieces don't add up to a convincing whole, and while this album is never quite boring, Gravity tries a bit too hard and ends up an interesting misfire. \n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Losing A Friend\n[02] Godspell\n[03] Drip Drop Teardrop\n[04] Overload\n[05] I Need Some Fine Wine And You, You Need To Be Nicer\n[06] DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Blame Your Daughter (Diamonds)\n[07] Little Black Cloud\n[08] In The Round\n[09] Holy Love\n[10] Good Morning Joan\n[11] And Then You Kissed Me II\n \n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t&gt; 00h:40m:30s\n\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 104mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes v8.2.0.23 MP3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\n\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Pop Rock\n\nRelease Date\t&gt; 14 October 2005\n\nRecord Company\t&gt; Universal Music\n\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; http://www.cardigans.com\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6be63b4fa39e2459816e031fe4ff7145de6a700","amp;dn":"%5B2005%5D+Super+Extra+Gravity+-+The+Cardigans+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6be63b4fa39e2459816e031fe4ff7145de6a700","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,190,99,180,250,57,226,69,152,22,224,49,254,79,247,20,93,230,167,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
