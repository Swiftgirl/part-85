This success culminated in tours of the UK where they performed live in concert. A live album was subsequently released.\n\nThe group came to prominence in the summer of 1982 when the series first aired in the UK and a single &quot;Hi Fidelity&quot; reached No.5.[3] Along with this an album was released: The Kids from &quot;Fame&quot;, which reached No.1 for 12 weeks.[4][5] A series of singles and albums followed over the next 12 months with songs taken from the show's first three seasons.[6] By the summer of 1983, interest in the show was beginning to wane and the releases abruptly stopped, although the TV series carried on for a number of years.\nThe main vocalists of the group were Debbie Allen, Valerie Landsburg, Erica Gimpel, Carlo Imperato, Gene Anthony Ray, Lee Curreri, Lori Singer and P.R. Paul.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cefb082072957645e2ea9f104044a9b6e5c04fe","amp;dn":"The+Kids+From+Fame+-+Vinylrip+-+Abrasax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cefb082072957645e2ea9f104044a9b6e5c04fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,239,176,130,7,41,87,100,94,46,169,241,4,4,74,155,110,92,4,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
