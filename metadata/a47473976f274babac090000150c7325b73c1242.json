PowerDVD 9 feature highlights include the new TrueTheater Technology, which is offering DVD up-scaling to HD-like quality Cinema Mode for watching Blu-ray Discs via Windows Media Center. It is a suite of advanced video and audio enhancement technologies such as the &quot;TrueTheater HD&quot; that up-scales DVD video for HD-like results and the &quot;TrueTheater Motion&quot; that up-converts DVD video frame rates for smoother playback. In additon, the &quot;TrueTheater Stretch&quot; technology stretches video without image distortion, while the &quot;TrueTheater Lighting&quot; enhances video image for a brighter, clearer movie. Last but not least, the &quot;TrueTheater Surround&quot; creates multichannel audio output for conventional stereo speakers.\n\nThe &quot;Cinema Mode&quot; option displays menu items and movie information in a larger format for home theater viewing on larger displays. Cinema Mode also integrates with Microsoft Windows Media Center to provide Blu-ray Disc playback. &quot;FancyView&quot; enables a navigation experience with animated, catalog-style browsing functionality. It is a fun way to browse through titles in a user?s Movie Collection, as a way of previewing chapters on a DVD, and works in both Classic Mode and Cinema Mode. FancyView can be used with touch screens, a remote control, keyboard, and mouse. The &quot;Movie Collection&quot; feature has been updated to allow users to input and share information on Blu-ray Disc titles as well as DVDs. All information can be synced and shared on www.moovielive.com. Users can browse the titles in their Movie Collection using FancyView. As users roll over the titles they have watched using PowerDVD, the Flash Back display will show scenes from the movie.\n\nThe software also supportsHDMI version 1.3, high-definition video standards Blu-ray Disc, AVCREC and AVCHD, as well as high-definition audio formats Dolby TrueHD and DTS HD Master Audio, delivering the highest quality video playback on up to 7.1 channels of lossless audio. PowerDVD?s PC-friendly support of DxVA also promises to offer efficient playback of high-definition movies even on low-spec computer systems. CyberLink PowerDVD 9 is now available online and will be available in retail stores beginning in April, supporting the following languages: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish , Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Japanese, and Korean.
