Stepping beyond the persona of a singer and frontman, French wears the writer/guitarist/singer/producer hat(s) on this much anticipated debut recording with his new crew,ANNIE AUTOMATIC.\n\nWhen asked by writer Matt Miller, in the spring of 2009 (for an interview for Morbid's Top Unsigned Bands), what he wanted to do, French's reply was &quot;I just want to have fun and make something I love, with friends, and share it with anyone who digs it. I'd like to provide something sacred for everyone- that's all anybody really wants anyway.&quot;\n\nWith the Fighting Chances e.p., French had exactly that oppurtunity. Pooling close friends and associates accumulated over the course of the last few years, a killer team developed and contributed to this collection of highly unique, out-standing songs. David &quot;Ice&quot; Berg (a previous bass player for Palmerston, and close friend of French), Mike &quot;Beans&quot; Benigno (another close friend, drummer and writer), Dylan Howard (new friend and drummer for the band Unwritten Law) among others, all came together to help create a great moment in recent recorded music history.
