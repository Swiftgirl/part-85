What Really Happened is proud to be one of the oldest political blogs on the net.\nRivero runs the WhatReallyHappened radio show on GCN six days a week, and makes good use of his sharp wit to help his blog visitors and radio listeners not only to read/hear the news but to understand what IS really happening. \n\n===============================================================\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:478b4f19a9c8908c6d51ffba522680972cc3f362","amp;dn":"What+Really+Happened+-+2010+Feb+10+WE+%5Bsebaygo1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"478b4f19a9c8908c6d51ffba522680972cc3f362","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,139,79,25,169,200,144,140,109,81,255,186,82,38,128,151,44,195,243,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
