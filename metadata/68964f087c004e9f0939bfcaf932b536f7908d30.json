However, when his decision to mount a small radar on his vehicle threatens to interfere with Dr. Wurman's project, tensions between the two rise. TVN's driver Joel Taylor has second thoughts about chasing with the team, when his and Reed's relationship becomes strained. With his much improved TIV2 finally out of the shop, Sean is feeling confident and happy to rejoin his old chasing partner, Dr. Wurman and his new VORTEX2 project. However, when Dr. Wurman seem less than thrilled to see Sean, and makes it clear that getting TIV2 inside a tornado is no longer high on his list of priorities, Sean is somewhat offended, and decides to resume chasing alone with Doghouse, at least temporarily. \n\n\nThe episode is in HDTV quality .avi rip.\n\nPlease stay patience and SEED after download.\n\nIf there is anything youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re looking for, please let me know. \n\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68964f087c004e9f0939bfcaf932b536f7908d30","amp;dn":"Storm+Chasers+-+S03E03+-+Highway+to+Hail","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68964f087c004e9f0939bfcaf932b536f7908d30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,150,79,8,124,0,78,159,9,57,191,202,249,50,181,54,247,144,141,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
