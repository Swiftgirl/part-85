It was inspired by the fact that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle based the character of Sherlock Holmes on his tutor at the University of Edinburgh Dr Joseph Bell, and that Bell did occasionally do forensic work for the Edinburgh police. The series exaggerated the similarity between Bell and Holmes for dramatic effect, with Doyle acting as Watson, and included several scenes from the books (the assumption being that these would later inspire Doyle's fiction).\n\nLength: 1:28:50\nSize: 699 MB\nVideo Codec: XviD\nResolution: 672x384\nFrame rate: 29 f/s\nAudio Codec: MPGA\nData Rate: 27 kbs\nBitrate: 137 kbs \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6f637ab7ae0e4397b61a0b6e24d621af26ceb57","amp;dn":"Murder+Rooms+-+The+White+Knight+Stratagem-The+Dark+Beginnings+of","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6f637ab7ae0e4397b61a0b6e24d621af26ceb57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,246,55,171,122,224,228,57,123,97,160,182,226,77,98,26,242,108,235,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
