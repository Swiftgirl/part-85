In           \n         the 1960s, this symbol of the United States became an         \n         emblem of environmental degradation as the pesticide          \n         DDT and other human pressures brought it to the brink of      \n         extinction. Following their protection as an endangered       \n         species, bald eagles have come roaring back. Photographed     \n         by Emmy-winning cinematographer Neil Rettig, this film        \n         focuses on the drama of the nest. Even in the best of         \n         times, it's a surprisingly tough struggle to maintain         \n         a one-ton home and raise chicks until they can hunt on        \n          their own.                                                    \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n         Release  Notes    \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n          Group Greets     \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                           CTU, ORENJi, 2HD, DHD                       \n                                                                        \n            and all other groups that choose quality over speed         \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n        \n       Contact Info      \n                                      \n                                        \n                                                                  \n       We are currently looking for:                                  \n                                                                       \n           * US/CA cappers with HDTV and/or DSR feed - min 60 kB/s      \n                                                                        \n         GROUP NEWS: No, we will not affil your brand new/DR/colo site, \n                     so please don't ask.
