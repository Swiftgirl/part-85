(The Quality Music Project)\n\nIn this project we, fellow pirates share only quality items out of our CD collections in lossless FLAC and include covers, especially for those who like to burn and print and put it in a nice and shiny jewelcase. Well, you all know the drill\n\nPlease feel free to join the TQMP project!\n\nThe &quot;rules&quot; are simple: Rip your CD (no 1980's cassettetapes or vinylrips please!) in lossless format AND include artwork. Include cue- and logfiles for the purists and the TQMP searchtag in your title, so it can easily be found. (Yes, on Google as well..)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8af583d238bf23da21a790094dbd7d22b7ab299b","amp;dn":"Ana+Dorei+-+This+is+the+Beginning+of+the+End+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8af583d238bf23da21a790094dbd7d22b7ab299b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,245,131,210,56,191,35,218,33,167,144,9,77,189,125,34,183,171,41,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
