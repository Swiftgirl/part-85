The facts that the film shows happened in 1924. Manoel Henrique Pereira was born in 1895. Capoeira fighters change their names upon graduation; the ceremony is called christening. Therefore, Manoel became Besouro de MangangÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ (AÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­lton Carmo), which means MangangÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ Beetle. The film starts with the murder of Master AlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­pio (MacalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©), Besouro's coach. Master AlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­pio was killed by bodyguards of Colonel VenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ncio (FlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡vio Rocha), an officer of the extinct Brazilian National Guard. Since Besouro was in charge of protecting Master AlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­pio, capoeira fighters and other members of the black community deemed him responsible for the death of the old coach. Therefore, he was not allowed to take part of the coach's funerals.\n\nAfter the death of AlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­pio, bodyguards of Colonel VenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ncio intensified oppression against the black community. At some point of the story, Besouro starts a kind of guerrilla warfare, setting fire to plantations, and destroying machineries. VenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ncio's bodyguards retaliated with punitive actions against the black community. Quero-quero (ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡nderson Santos), a friend of Besouro's, concludes that the best policy was to side with Colonel VenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ncio against Besouro. DinorÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ (JÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ssica Barbosa), a capoeira fighter and Quero-quero's lover, takes the side of Besouro, and leaves Quero-quero.\n\nMany Brazilian negroes (they prefer this denomination) believe in the existence of OrixÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s, gods of Nature. Even today, people believe that Exu, a god, protected Bersouro against atacks of his enemies. Upset by the loss of his wife, Quero-quero reveals to Colonel VenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ncio that the best way of neutralizing Exu's protection was to attack Besouro with a knife made of a certain wood. VenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ncio's bodyguards prepare the knife, and kill Besouro.\n\nAt the time of Besouro's death, DinorÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ was pregnant of his son. The film ends with one of Besouro's friends teaching capoeira to the son of Besouro and DinorÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡.\n\nCapoeira is an acrobatic art of self-defense, that one can see in films like Harry-Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Meet the Fockers, etc. It requires skills that are similar to Artistic Gymnastics. All actors are extremely skilfull. In many theaters, Brazilians gave a standing ovation to JÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ssica Barbosa's scene, when her personage avoids being raped by Colonel VenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ncio by dropping her knive, and leading him to believe that she was helpless. JÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ssica moves rapidly stepping on the wall of her house, and attacks the enemy with powerful kicks. It is worthwhile to see this scene.\n\nNobody knows for sure how Besouro was killed. The film shows one of the many reconstructions of his death. In 1973, I interviewed one of his students in SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o Jose dos Campos and, as far as I remember, his reconstruction of the story was very similar to the version presented in the film.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f6a3e78dff4684cbc9eab59d12b3f599510a32c","amp;dn":"Besouro+-+Danish+subtitles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f6a3e78dff4684cbc9eab59d12b3f599510a32c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,106,62,120,223,244,104,76,188,158,171,89,209,43,63,89,149,16,163,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
