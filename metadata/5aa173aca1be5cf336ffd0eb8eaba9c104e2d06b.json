D-Day ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the Shortest Day is not just another war documentary with a lot of archive material. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a blue sky and clear green watered reflection on the same Normandy beaches captured in barbed wire black-and-white years after, offering insight and personal revelations, as well as historical fact. There are in-depth interviews with a confessional tone from women and men on all sides, including civilians and resistance workers; an experiential journey, through personal narrative intercut with portraits, newsreels and war archives. Viewers can walk a few steps in a soldierÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s shoes and try to understand the intensity of facing the horror of untimely death on a minute-by-minute basis.\n\nRare archival footage is digitally enhanced with close-ups and sen-surround sound. A clip of airships is attended by explosive combat sounds, original voiceover or seamlessly accompanied by spoken personal testament. Eyewitness accounts also come together. Two men in the same company speak separately about the same experience - blowing up German guns. An incident involving a young French women cycling to the beaches looking for a lost swimming costume is seen from multiple viewpoints by several independent witnesses, including the lady herself. There are allied soldiers from every layer of society and German soldiers to offer a counterpoint. The documentary examines interesting relationships like that of the immigrant German in the US Army fighting against the Germans, while his family waited to become naturalised citizens in the USA. No Australians feature, except in hearsay. \n\nThis personal journey is amply supported by military fact as the story begins with an examination of the effects of the Great Depression, which left many without a job (on both sides) until they joined up. However, the full-scale reality of American troops in England with camps disguised in forests, and the massive planning of D-Day soon soars into personal memories; like that of a war ministry secretary hanging out her window listening to the roar of the sky blackening with craft on its way to start the invasion. The engineers' brilliance in devising floating fort-ports to support the troop invasion is all there too, but somewhat over-shadowed by the personal legacies divulged: the emotions of hate towards perverted trained SS killers; the joy and anxiety of killing; and the shocking casual brutality of war crimes on both sides. There are highs as well as lows and scars from the emotions and experiences encountered, much like the now-green pockmarked shores of Normandy itself. \n\nRated PG - be prepared for a few close-ups of fly-infested corpses, but realistically not much worse than what is enacted on news screens each night. A map pinpoints the Allied Invasion Force and German positions. After sharing the experiences, viewers will understand why one soldier felt that they should, 'get the hell out of it as quick as you could.' This is a truly insightful exploration of the machinations of World War Two, and the subsequent impact upon a generation.

It also records one of the campaignÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s worst atrocities that cost the lives of 20 Canadian troops ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and the impact on the men who unearthed the war crime.\n\nCrucial to the success of the D-Day landings was one of the greatest feats of deception in history. Decoy troop activity was centered on Kent, to fool the Germans into thinking that the Normandy landings were a feint, to be followed by a main thrust across the short-sea route from Kent to Calais. The Germans were convinced and kept vital forces in the Pas de Calais, miles away from Normandy where the vital battles were being won and lost. The build up had taken three years and the full moon on June 5th presented the ideal date for the invasion of occupied France. The weaponry and vehicles were loaded, the troops had embarked, when the halt was called due to foul weather. A dayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s delay and a tense decision by General Eisenhower in the early hours of June 5th gave D-Day June 6th, 1944, its place in history.\n\nThe ingenuity of the Allied plan, included purpose-built harbours, devised to land the troops on the shallow beaches. Sections of the harbours were brought from all around the country where they had been manufactured in separate parts, unrecognisable as to their end purpose, and transported in great secrecy to the vessels for assembly on the Normandy coast. A fuel pipeline, codenamed Pluto, was laid on the sea bed in order to supply the vehicles.\n\nTold in vividand ingenious use of archive film.\n\nRated: PG\nDuration: 52 mins.\nReleased: 2008","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5aa173aca1be5cf336ffd0eb8eaba9c104e2d06b","amp;dn":"D-Day+%28The+Shortest+Day%29+%28World+War+II%29+%28Documentary%29+%5BDVDRip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5aa173aca1be5cf336ffd0eb8eaba9c104e2d06b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,161,115,172,161,190,92,243,54,255,208,235,142,171,169,193,4,226,208,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
