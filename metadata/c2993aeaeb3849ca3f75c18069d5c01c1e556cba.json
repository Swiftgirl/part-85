With an easy baritone that came across as a sort of late-night version of Sam Cooke on too many whiskey shots, Harris arguably did his best work with Jewel Records, a Louisiana label owned and run by Stan &quot;The Record Man&quot; Lewis. While he didn't have any huge hits between 1965 and 1971, the length of his stay at Jewel, Harris nonetheless produced some solid material.\n\n\n01 - Peppermint Harris - I Got Loaded\n02 - Peppermint Harris - Just You And Me\n03 - Peppermint Harris - Right Back On It\n04 - Peppermint Harris - Have Another Drink And Talk To Me\n05 - Peppermint Harris - Hey Little Schoolgirl\n06 - Peppermint Harris - ThereÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s A Dead Cat On The Line\n07 - Peppermint Harris - I Always End Up Blue\n08 - Peppermint Harris - P.H.
