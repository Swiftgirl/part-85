All of them are official, and there are loads of unofficial utilities available out there.\nYou also probably need DosBOX to run the game. Burn it on a CD or mount it, either inside dosbox or using Daemon Tools. Instructions for this can be obtained at the DosBOX wiki. Also, an excellent source of information for all the Elder Scrolls games is www.uesp.net.\nAnd seed, please. This is to my understanding a very rare game on the net.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe927e0978be668bef8e4767825aa7a2a67723c8","amp;dn":"TES2%3A+Daggerfall","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe927e0978be668bef8e4767825aa7a2a67723c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,146,126,9,120,190,102,139,239,142,71,103,130,90,167,162,166,119,35,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
