Bethel (Sullivan County) is 43 miles (69 km) southwest of the town of Woodstock, New York, which is in adjoining Ulster County.\n\nTo many, the festival exemplified the counterculture of the 1960s and the &quot;hippie era.&quot; Thirty-two of the best-known musicians of the day appeared during the sometimes rainy weekend. Although attempts have been made over the years to recreate the festival, the original event has proven to be unique and legendary. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest moments in popular music history and was listed on Rolling Stone's 50 Moments That Changed the History of Rock and Roll. The event was captured in a successful 1970 movie, Woodstock; an accompanying soundtrack album; and Joni Mitchell's song &quot;Woodstock&quot;, which commemorated the event and became a major hit for Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young.\n\nDirector:Michael Wadleigh\nRelease Date:26 March 1970 (USA)\nGenre:Documentary / Music \nTagline:love, peace, music\nAwards:Won Oscar.
