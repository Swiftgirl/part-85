Writing on the Tea Party movement, the New York Times observes, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt is a sprawling rebellion, but running through it is a narrative of impending tyranny.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The tea party movement will play a central role at the Conservative Political Action Conference, CPAC, that kicks off in Washington, D.C. on Thursday where IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be broadcasting from both Thursday &amp; Friday. 50 Tea Party leaders are discussing campaign strategies and conservative principles with RNC Chairman Michael Steele in Washington today. One of the Tea Party organizers said that they will also set up a meeting with the DNC, although they readily admit they agree with more of the Republican platform.  On the other hand, if Democrats were to take an anti-corporate position, and successfully message to the Tea Partiers how Republicans are totally in bed with the big corporations, there may be some chance for the Dems to get in on this growing populist movement.  That, of course, would require some good common sense, good messaging, and a spine on the part of the Democrats.  DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t hold your breath.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b01a26f3adf973585d5a81e7b3ce8054cd78cd44","amp;dn":"The+Thom+Hartmann+Show+-+Feb+17+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b01a26f3adf973585d5a81e7b3ce8054cd78cd44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,26,38,243,173,249,115,88,93,90,129,231,179,206,128,84,205,120,205,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
