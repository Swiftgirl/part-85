Guitarist Ricky Wilson died of AIDS during the recording. With the band too distraught to tour, the album received minimal promotion and failed to yield any hits despite some stations initially giving good airplay to &quot;Summer of Love&quot;.\n\nTrack listing\n\n1.&quot;Summer of Love&quot; (Pierson, Strickland, C.
