With the clock ticking, Jack concocts the       \n mother of all media stunts, killing two birds with one  \n unforgettable stone on the road to redemption. The      \n scheme entangles an eclectic collection of colorful     \n locals navigating their way through unpredictable       \n twists and turns. A plump private eye teams with a      \n macabre webmistress to investigate the strange          \n disappearance of a dead body. A glassy-eyed cheddar     \n head falls prey to a phony get-rich-quick guru.         \n Imperiled actors embark on a quest for a fresh corpse.  \n Cops in costume, a peculiar special effects make-up     \n team, porn stars with dreams of stardom, a Jewish drug  \n lord with very large brothers, Russian mobsters and     \n others converge in this unique roller-coaster ride of   \n comedy, mystery, murder and mayhem through the          \n underbelly of modern day Sodom and Gomorrah.            \n                                                         \n\n\n\n\n  C A S T  \n\n\n                                                         \n                                                         \n              Kevin Nealon ...
