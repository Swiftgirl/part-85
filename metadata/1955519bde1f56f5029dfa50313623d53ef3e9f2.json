Using a modified id Tech 2 engine, the game features a mix of a third-person camera with a first-person shooter's action, making for a new gaming experience at the time.\n\n\nThis port supports Widescreen Resolutions.\nSome Work, and Some dont.\n\nThe standard resolution is 1920x1200, but it can be changed via. the Video menu, in the game.\n\nThe game only supports 4:3 resolutions from the ingame menu, so if you want to use your widescreen resolution you have to do the following:\n\n\nThe first thing you need to get is an Hex Editor.\nFor mac,  HexFiend is Great.\n\nRightclick on the Heretic 2 icon, click Show Package Content.\nNavigate to: Contents -&gt; Shared Support -&gt; CrossoverGames -&gt; Support -&gt; Default -&gt; Drive_c -&gt; Program Files -&gt; Heretic\nDrag the file &quot;quake2.dll&quot;, to your desktop.\n\n\n Open HexFiend, and locate the quake2.dll file on your desktop. Open it.\n\nStart by pressing &quot;CMD+F&quot;, to find a line. Mark the radiobutton ASCII.\nWrite:     1920\nAnd press Next.\n\n\nFind number 00800700, and 00B00400 (Usually next to eachother), to the left, from &quot;1920&quot; in the Hex part of the editor.\n\nThe part &quot;8007&quot;, and &quot;B004&quot;, and the ones that need to be changed.\n\n8007 is the screen width and B004 is the height.\nChange the two numbers (When you press delete, or backspace, it removes 2 digits. Remember that!!!) , into the resolution in the table below:\n\nFor example, if i want to change my resolution to 1280 x 720, \nill change 8007 to 0005, and B004 to D002\n\nAfter you have made your change, save the file, and drag it back into the Heretic 2 folder. Remember to make a backup of the original quake2.dll, if you mess something up.\n\n\nResolutions:\n\n_____________\n1650  x   1050\n90 06    1A 04\n_____________\n1440  x   900\nA0 05     84 03\n\n_____________\n1280   x   720\n00 05     D0 02\n\nNot every resolution work in full screen, but check it out.\nIf your resolution is not supported, use the original quake2.dll file, and play the game using a standard ingame resolution.\n\n\n\n\nMUSIC SUPPORT!\nThe music in Heretic 2, is played from the original Heretic 2 cd, and cant be ripped and used without the Cd. What a shame... BUT, the port does support the original cd. If you have it, pop it in the drive, and mark &quot;CD Music&quot;, in the ingame menu, and everything should be fine :)\n\n\nENJOY!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1955519bde1f56f5029dfa50313623d53ef3e9f2","amp;dn":"%5B++Heretic+2++-++for+Mac++%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1955519bde1f56f5029dfa50313623d53ef3e9f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,85,81,155,222,31,86,245,2,157,250,80,49,54,35,213,62,243,233,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
