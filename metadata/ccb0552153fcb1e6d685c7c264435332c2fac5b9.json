A must have for everyone, especially if you like Scarlatti style sonatas. Front and back scans included for each CD. All 13 CD's are in .flac format, separate tracks. Personally I like Rowland's version more than the Bob van Asperen version. But of course van Asperen also created something amazing.\n\n\n\nSEED BIGTIME AFTER COMPLETION, PLEASE!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccb0552153fcb1e6d685c7c264435332c2fac5b9","amp;dn":"Antonio+Soler+COMPLETE+Sonatas+-+Gilbert+Rowland","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccb0552153fcb1e6d685c7c264435332c2fac5b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,176,85,33,83,252,177,230,214,133,199,194,100,67,83,50,194,250,197,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
