A rising star at agri-industry giant Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), Whitacre suddenly turns whistleblower. Even as he exposes his companyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s multi-national price-fixing conspiracy to the FBI, Whitacre envisions himself being hailed as a hero of the common man and handed a promotion. But before all that can happen, the FBI needs evidence, so Whitacre eagerly agrees to wear a wire and carry a hidden tape recorder in his briefcase, imagining himself as a kind of de facto secret agent. Unfortunately for the FBI, their lead witness hasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t been quite so forthcoming about helping himself to the corporate coffers. WhitacreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ever-changing account frustrates the agents and threatens the case against ADM as it becomes almost impossible to decipher what is real and what is the product of WhitacreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rambling imagination. Based on the true story of the highest-ranking corporate whistleblower in U.S. history.\n\nTrailer | http://www.traileraddict.com/trailer/the-informant/trailer\nGenre: Comedy | Crime | Drama | Thriller\nRelease Date: 12 November 2009 (Germany)\nDirector: Steven Soderbergh\nRuntime: 158 min\nRatings: IMDB: 7.1/10 (6,635 votes ) | RT: 77%\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1130080/\nhttp://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1200661-informant/\n\nThe Informant!
