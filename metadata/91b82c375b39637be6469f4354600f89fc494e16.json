She told us her story one night while my mates and I were having a few beers down there. It touched me so much that I felt inspired to write about it.\n\nRecorded at Bleedin' Ear Studio, Mandurah, Western Australia, this song features Trudy on backing vocals and Walter Moroz on Keyboard/String synth.\n\nPlease feel free to comment on what you think. Thanks guys.\n\nJeff","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91b82c375b39637be6469f4354600f89fc494e16","amp;dn":"Jeff+Hayman+-+Leahs+Song","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91b82c375b39637be6469f4354600f89fc494e16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,184,44,55,91,57,99,123,230,70,159,67,84,96,15,137,252,73,78,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
