Founded on December 4, 1998, Warehouse gives fan early access to concert tickets, exclusive CDs and merchandise to its members.\n\nStarting in 1999, Warehouse club members received an annual gift package. Membership packages are mailed to members that joined or renewed in that year. After the original package in 1999, all membership packages included an exclusive Warehouse CD. Warehouse 5 volumes [1-3] contain five live tracks from various tours. In 2003, the first Warehouse 8 volume was released and distributed to those who had been members for three years or more.
