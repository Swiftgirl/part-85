It is their first single in seven years from their 2009 album, Full Circle, their first album in eight years. The single was released digitally on August 25, 2009.\n\nThe radio world premiere of the full song took place August 18, 2009 at 5:13pm PDT on Alternative Rock Station KCXX in San Bernardino, California.\n\nThe music video was shot at their August 18 concert at the Comcast Center in Mansfield, Massachusetts and premiered on Tuesday, September 15, 2009 on Yahoo Music, one day earlier than expected. It is only the second non-conceptual Creed video (the first being &quot;Higher&quot;) and contains not only live footage but also candid shots of the band backstage.\n\nSince the song's release on radio, &quot;Overcome&quot; has received extremely positive reviews from radio disc jockeys and fans. It is notable for being one of Creed's much heavier singles. On the day it was digitally released, it reached number 3 on the iTunes Top 100 Rock Songs. It has since reached number 2. It also debuted at #18 at Billboard's Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, and has since reached #4 on the list, and #73 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nAs of September 17, 2009, the song reached the #1 spot on the Alternative Addiction chart.\n\nFull Circle is the fourth album by the American rock band Creed, released on October 27, 2009. It is Creed's first release since their 2004 compilation album Greatest Hits, their first studio album since 2001's Weathered, and their first studio album to feature original bassist Brian Marshall in almost exactly a decade. The record was produced by Howard Benson. The album was completed on July 31, 2009, as announced by Scott Stapp. Four days later, the album cover was revealed through the band's official e-news.\n\nCreed is an American rock band from Tallahassee, Florida that became popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The band disbanded in 2004 after three multi-platinum albums, selling 26 million records in the United States alone, and an estimated 35 million records worldwide. On April 27, 2009, after months of speculation, Creed announced that they had reformed via their official website, which confirmed that plans to record a new album titled Full Circle were underway and was updated with dates for a 2009 reunion tour. The band went on tour in support of the new album, which was released on October 27, 2009.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01eba240a716559147e07d43a6af09e11a61ff99","amp;dn":"Creed+-+Overcome+++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01eba240a716559147e07d43a6af09e11a61ff99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,235,162,64,167,22,85,145,71,224,125,67,166,175,9,225,26,97,255,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
