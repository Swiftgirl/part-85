The album topped out at #27 on the Country Albums chart and one of its tracks entered into the Top 40 of the Hot Country Singles chart: &quot;I Knew Love&quot; rose to #37. Two more tracks also charted, but at much lower positions: &quot;Never Mind&quot; at #58, and &quot;Anyone Can Be Somebody's Fool&quot; at #64. However, that was to be the last time that any of Griffith's songs would enter the country singles charts at all, because no single from any subsequent album would rise even that high.\n\n[edit] LP track listing\n[edit] Side one\n&quot;Anyone Can Be Somebody's Fool&quot; (Nanci Griffith) - 2:39 \n&quot;I Knew Love&quot; (Roger Brown) - 3:17 \n&quot;Never Mind&quot; (Harlan Howard) - 3:42 \n&quot;Love Wore a Halo (Back Before the War)&quot; (Griffith) - 3:23 \n&quot;So Long Ago&quot; (Griffith) - 4:10 \n&quot;Gulf Coast Highway&quot; [duet with Mac McAnally] (James Hooker, Griffith, Danny Flowers) - 3:06 \n[edit] Side two\n&quot;Little Love Affairs&quot; (Griffith, Hooker) - 3:08 \n&quot;I Wish It Would Rain&quot; (Griffith) - 2:38 \n&quot;Outbound Plane&quot; (Griffith, Tom Russell) - 2:39 \n&quot;I Would Change My Life&quot; (Robert Earl Keen, Jr) - 3:08 \n&quot;Sweet Dreams Will Come&quot; [duet with John Stewart] (John Stewart) - 4:25 \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d8b32b39a00f8ba7ac4efc5fc583e71f5dfb745","amp;dn":"Nanci+Griffith...Little+Love+Affairs%281988%29%5BFLAC%5D---DICKTHESPIC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d8b32b39a00f8ba7ac4efc5fc583e71f5dfb745","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,139,50,179,154,0,248,186,122,196,239,197,252,88,62,113,245,223,183,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
