Next, while celebrating St. Patrick's Day with friends, the two get into a bar brawl with three Russian mobsters who wanted to evict the pub, as a result the Russians receive a sound beating. The morning after, two of the Russians seek revenge on Connor and Murphy, who kill their attackers in self-defense.\n\nFBI Special Agent Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe) is assigned to the case and surmises that the death of the Russians was not a professional hit, but probable self-defense. The brothers decide to clear their names and arrive at the police station, where they find that the police and local news reporters see them as heroes. To avoid press attention the brothers decide to spend the night in a holding cell, where they receive an apparent vision from God telling them to hunt down wicked men so that the innocent will flourish.\n\nConnor and Murphy resolve to rid Boston of &quot;evil men&quot;, with their friend and former mob errand boy Rocco (David Della Rocco) eventually joining them to help. Connor learns of a meeting of Russian syndicate bosses at a hotel from a pager taken from one of the dead Russian mobsters and the brothers quickly kill nine bosses and underbossesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½saving the leader, Yuri Petrova ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ later referred to as &quot;Fat/Fag Man&quot; for last. They recite their family prayer and kill him with two gunshots to the back of the head ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the bullets cross and go out his eyes. They place coins on the eyes of all nine bodies, as if to pay the toll to cross the River Styx.\n\nAfter hunting down Vincenzo Lipazzi (Ron Jeremy), underboss of the Yakavetta crime family, the three vigilantes undertake a series of increasingly violent missions, cleansing the city of the most vicious criminals. In response to this threat, Giuseppe &quot;Papa Joe&quot; Yakavetta (Carlo Rota) contracts the feared hitman, Il Duce (Billy Connolly) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ literally &quot;The Leader&quot; in Italian (although through its use by various Italian nobles it may also be interpreted as &quot;the Duke&quot;, which may be more fitting here) and originally nickname of Benito MussoliniÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ to deal with the vigilantes. After killing a criminal at his house, the three men are ambushed by Il Duce. Although they manage to chase Il Duce away, the three men suffer from wounds, one of which loses Rocco part of his finger. Hours later as the police conduct an investigation on the spot of where the firefight took place, Smecker finds the part of the finger that Rocco lost. Smecker decides to do an independent investigation to see who was behind the gun battle, and is able to track the evidence down to Rocco and his two allies. This puts Smecker in a difficult position as he decides on whether he should go on and prosecute the three men, or if he should help them in their cause. After receiving advice from a reluctant priest, Smecker decides to help the three men. Later the brothers and Rocco infiltrate the Yakavetta headquarters to finish off the family. They are captured, and Rocco is shot and killed by Papa Joe. The brothers escape from their chains, and as they say their family prayer over Rocco, Il Duce enters the room, unseen as their backs are to him. As he recites the family prayer with them, it becomes clear that Il Duce is the brothers' father. He joins them in their mission to kill all wrongdoers. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144117/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144117/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPLEASE SEED AND ENJOY THANKS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:816f9977d7224a54a0f4302579cac643937ac1a6","amp;dn":"The-Boondock-Saints.DVDrip%5Bvice%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"816f9977d7224a54a0f4302579cac643937ac1a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,111,153,119,215,34,74,84,160,244,48,37,121,202,198,67,147,122,193,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
