The show's central character is Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), an unconventional, maverick medical genius who heads a team of diagnosticians at the fictional Princeton Plainsboro Teaching Hospital (PPTH) in New Jersey. The character has similarities to Sherlock Holmes: both are forensic geniuses, musicians, drug users, aloof, and largely friendless.\n\nSeason 1 - 22 episodes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:303313b68a63f03c7e32de2a2b4d1b21cb86594b","amp;dn":"House%2C+MD+-+Season+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"303313b68a63f03c7e32de2a2b4d1b21cb86594b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,51,19,182,138,99,240,60,126,50,222,42,43,77,27,33,203,134,89,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
