Darth Vader (Stewie) is hunting the rebel Luke Skywalker (Chris) and his troops relentlessly across the galaxy. On the ice planet Hoth, Luke has a vision of his late mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi (Herbert), telling him to go to the Dagobah system to learn the ways of the Force under Jedi Master Yoda (Carl). Meanwhile Princess Leia (Lois) finds herself taking a shine to the scruffy pilot Han Solo (Peter) and, against all odds, the two soon fall in love. But an encounter with HanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s old friend Lando Calrissian (Mort) lands them in the clutches of the Empire. Envisioning this, Luke chooses to forgo his Jedi training to save his friends. It all comes to a head in a climactic confrontation with Darth Vader himself\n\n[b]Converted to MP4 with WinAVI MP4 Converter\n\nPlease seed after you have downloaded so other can finish there download[/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ca1a233a7831487a6e97caf64133a2be4875c63","amp;dn":"Family+Guy+Something%2C+Something%2C+Something+Dark+Side+2009+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ca1a233a7831487a6e97caf64133a2be4875c63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,161,162,51,167,131,20,135,166,233,124,175,100,19,58,43,228,135,92,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
