The show's central character is Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), an unconventional, maverick medical genius who heads a team of diagnosticians at the fictional Princeton Plainsboro Teaching Hospital (PPTH) in New Jersey. The character has similarities to Sherlock Holmes: both are forensic geniuses, musicians, drug users, aloof, and largely friendless.\n\nSeason 4 - 16 episodes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3991265ed5b31fbca3fb64db215b349aba30f482","amp;dn":"House%2C+MD+-+Season+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3991265ed5b31fbca3fb64db215b349aba30f482","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,145,38,94,213,179,31,188,163,251,100,219,33,91,52,154,186,48,244,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
