Today they still play sold-out venues around the\nworld. Not long ago, 152,000 South Americans came to 15 SCORPIONS concerts\nbetween Rio de Janeiro and Mexico City. Their song &quot;Wind of Change&quot; has become\nan anthem for the fall of the Iron Curtain. The tour will launch in the band's\nhome country Germany in May. After that, they will be touring through North\nAmerica before they continue their journey through five other continents until\n2012.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nInfo:\n\nLike it? Buy it!
