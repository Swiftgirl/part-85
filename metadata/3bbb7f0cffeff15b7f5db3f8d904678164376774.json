Rescue efforts wind up trapping more members \nof the Heap family, as well as a visitor from the far North, in the \nsame situation. The time-travel elements are head spinning, but moments \nof faltering logic will go unnoticed as readers savor the quirky storytelling, \nmarked by a sprawling, omniscient purview and plenty of entertaining \ntangents. With entries as strong as this one, Sage's efforts will continue \nto stand strong within the crowded young-wizard niche. Jennifer Mattson--\nCopyright Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© American Library Association.

Queen Etheldredda \nis as awful in death as she was in life, and she's still up to no good. \nHer diabolical plan to give herself everlasting life requires Jenna's \ncompliance, Septimus's disappearance, and the talents of her son, Marcellus \nPye, a famous Alchemist and Physician. And if Queen Etheldredda's plot \ninvolves Jenna and Septimus, then it will surely involve Nicko, Alther \nMella, Marcia Overstrand, Beetle, Stanley, Sarah, Silas, Spit Fyre, \nAunt Zelda, and all of the other wacky, wonderful characters that made \nmagyk and flyte so memorable.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bbb7f0cffeff15b7f5db3f8d904678164376774","amp;dn":"Angie+Sage+-+Septimus+Heap+Book+3+-+Physik","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bbb7f0cffeff15b7f5db3f8d904678164376774","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,187,127,12,255,239,241,91,127,93,179,248,217,4,103,129,100,55,103,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
