The show was a general talk show consisting of political commentary, interviews and listener call-in shows. The majority of shows were extremely casual and of a comedic nature, and generally very enjoyable to listen to. For those listeners who were unable to tune into the radio at the appropriate time, the radio show was then uploaded as a podcast episode available for download.\n\nSadly, the show broadcast its last episode on March 2nd of 2007, and the podcast disappeared from iTunes and most other popular podcast directories altogether. Thankfully, the official Penn and Teller fan site maintains a full MP3 archive of the show here - http://www.pennfans.net/category/Audio_Archive/PennRadio/\n\nThis torrent consists of my personal favorite episodes that I listened to in the last year of the show, labeled with the proper tags to properly identify the content of the show.
