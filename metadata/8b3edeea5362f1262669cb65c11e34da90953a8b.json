Sony Pictures Japan's Rain Fall, a thriller in the style of Bourne Ultimatum, stars Gary Oldman, is the first film in Japan to be shot on the new Panavision Genesis HD digital video camera jointly developed by Panavision and Sony. According to Panavision, the Genesis has a chip the size of a Super 35 mm frame, a log curve that emulates film, and a depth-of-field characteristic similar to film cameras. The camera has the equivalent of a 2,500 exposure index and its electronic shutter can be set to 360 degrees. Rain Fall is helmed by Max Mannix with Jack Wareham as director of photography. The film is adapted from a novel by best-selling American author Barry Eisler. It tells the story of a hit man who is forced to protect the daughter of one of his victims against the CIA. Besides Oldman, the film stars Kippei Shiina, Kyoko Hasegawa, Misa Shimizu, Akira Emoto, Takumi Bando, and Dirk Hunter. The lead in &quot;Rain Fall&quot; is Japanese, as are most of the cast, the setting, and dialogue. The most unusual thing about this film is that although the story is based on an American Novel, directed by an Australian director, this is a Japan movie production in the new trend of Asian film production going the &quot;Hollywood&quot; route and casting Western actors in a few roles.\n\n\nCast:\nGary Oldman\nKippei Shiina\nKyoko Hasegawa\nMisa Shimizu\nTakumi Bando\nAkira Emoto\nDirk Hunter\n\n\n\n\nFile Type: AVI\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Format: 640 x 272\nVideo Bitrate: 1312 kbps\nVideo Frame Rate: 23.98 fps\nFile Source: DVD R2\nAudio Codec: Dolby AC3 (Ch. 5 - 48000Hz)\nAudio Bitrate: 448 kbps\n\nAn AXiNE rip.\nAsiantorrents.\n\nMy upload page @ SB &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=33643&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=33643&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b3edeea5362f1262669cb65c11e34da90953a8b","amp;dn":"Rain+Fall+%5B2009%5D+DVDRip.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b3edeea5362f1262669cb65c11e34da90953a8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,62,222,234,83,98,241,38,38,105,203,101,193,30,52,218,144,149,58,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
