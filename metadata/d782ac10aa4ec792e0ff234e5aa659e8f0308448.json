One such man in uniform is sergeant John Forsythe, who falls in love with De Havilland, whom he mistakes for a model. Eventually Menjou is shown the error of his ways through the combined efforts of De Havilland and his own wife Myrna Loy, while Our Heroine finds true happiness as an Army wife. The Ambassador's Daughter was produced, written and directed by Norman Krasna, a renowned Hollywood wit whose comic gifts were apparently left back in California on this occasion. \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048944/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048944/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nDirector: Norman Krasna\n\n\n\n\n\tOlivia de Havilland\t... \tJoan Fisk\n\n\tJohn Forsythe\t... \tSgt.
