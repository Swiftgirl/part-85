Although the band never released a full album, they did manage a single: &quot;Motion Tree&quot; b/w &quot;Captain Midnight.&quot; The band consisted of Dennis Bassetti (bass, vocals), Bob Jonte (drums), Jack Lutz (lead vocals, guitar, keyboards), and Jerry Roy (lead guitar, vocals). Composed by Lutz, the music on this album is predominantly soft psychedelic pop with good guitar, a few effects, and a very British sound. The material offers good period charm and features a few standout songs that, if released in Britain in 1967, could've easily become hits. This release on Akarma Records (Akarma AK 043 / 1999) was officially licensed from All American and contains the band's entire output of 13 songs.\n(review by Keith Pettipas, All Music Guide)\n\nTracklist:\n- Motion Tree\n- Sweetwater Roll\n- Muffin Man\n- Mary Jane\n- Figure This\n- Captain Midnight\n- Lucky Lady\n- You For Me To Love\n- Mistah Moon Risin'\n- Marmalade Lady\n- Mr. Z's Backyard\n- What Is There Left\n- Rooms Of Laughter\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df3fda790f0de6cc204c84c12ed3966365cd313c","amp;dn":"ThunderMugs+-+On+The+Spot+%281969%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df3fda790f0de6cc204c84c12ed3966365cd313c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,63,218,121,15,13,230,204,32,76,132,193,46,211,150,99,101,205,49,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
