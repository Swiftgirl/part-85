New Line Cinema held the film rights to King's short story, and decided to combine &quot;Cyber God&quot; with some very minor elements of King's story. The resulting film, originally titled &quot;Stephen King's The Lawnmower Man&quot;, differed so much from the source material that King sued the filmmakers to remove his name from the title. After two court rulings in King's favor, New Line still did not comply and initially released the home video version as &quot;Stephen King's The Lawnmower Man&quot;. A third ruling granted the author $10,000 per day in compensation and all profits derived from sales until his name was removed. On King's official web-page, it is not listed among the films based on his work. The film was released in Japan under the title &quot;Virtual Wars&quot;.\n\nIf you want the original theatrical version, go for this R1 -release. It has a commentary that is not on the UK disc. The 12 deleted scenes found on R1 and R2 UK is the additional footage for the &quot;Director's Cut&quot;.\n\nThe R2 Scandinavian -release is the only known release with the full &quot;Director's Cut&quot; intact on the DVD, hence it's missing the 12 deleted scenes. However, it only has 4:3 transfer!\n\nR1 America - (New Line)\n\nCommentaries:\nCommentary by director Brett Leonard and producer Gimel Everett\n\nExtras:\nProduction notes\nTheatrical trailer\n12 deleted scenes\nInterviews with the\nEdited animated sequences with original music\nStoryboard comparison\n\nSubtitles: English HoH and Spanish\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.85:1\n\nPicture Format: ANAMORPHIC\n\nTV System: NTSC\n\nSoundtrack(s): English Dolby Digital 5.1\n\nFits on 2 DVD-5's.
