He was set up and sent to prison because he beat the Justice Department single-handedly (the only person in history to do so) and they wouldn't let it go. Now he's out. He's looking good. And he's back to the same old Jimbo.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:919be36287728001b5ccc5f996e006cf4c14a46c","amp;dn":"Jim+Traficant+Press+Conference+12-2009.flv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"919be36287728001b5ccc5f996e006cf4c14a46c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,155,227,98,135,114,128,1,181,204,197,249,150,224,6,207,76,20,164,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
