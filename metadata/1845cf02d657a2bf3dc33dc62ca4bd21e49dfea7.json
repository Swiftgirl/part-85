For example, you may need your phone to be           \n        silent from 11 pm to 5 am every day, and be in a meeting profile        \n        from 10:30 am to 11:30 am every Monday, all you need to do is to        \n        set up the schedules using SmartProfile,and then the application        \n        will take care of setting your phone to use proper profiles             \n        automatically. You can also let your phone switch to proper             \n        profiles based on your location, for example, switch to a               \n        meeting profile at home from 9:00 pm to 6:00 am every day, or           \n        switch to a silent profile in a theatre, then just let                  \n        SmartProfile remember the desired locations and it will manage          \n        proper profile schedules for you. You can also let SmartProfile         \n        turn on proper profiles based on your calendar events.                  \n                                                                                \n        SmartProfile supports multiple ways of saving the locations of          \n        your interests. For example, you can use a Bluetooth device as          \n        an indicator of a location, such as a Bluetooth enabled laptop          \n        at home, a Bluetooth dangle in your desktop; you can also use           \n        the availability of a WiFi network as a sign of location change,        \n        for example, a WLAN in your office building. Finally, you can           \n        also simply use your phone's own wireless connection as a               \n        location indicator.                                                     \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n\n\n\n                                                                       \n                                  Installation                         \n                                                                       \n\n\n        Register with any 10 Digit Key.                                         \n        &amp; Have phun :)                                                          \n                                                                                \n\n\n\n                                                                       \n                          How to Install Unsigned Apps                 \n                                                                       \n\n\n       Step 1: Make sure you have a file browser installed, it is running\n       and nothing else. Do not use the built-in Symbian browser,\n       but a program like X-Plore (free version works too).\n\n       Step 2: Send HelloCarbide and installserver.exe to your phone\n       (S60v3 Device). Do not open them yet.\n\n       Step 3: Close any programs that may be running on your phone,\n       except the file browser.\n\n       Step 4: Install and Run HelloCarbide.sis. Now go to options,\n       then to menu1. Keep Pressing the selection key untill it crashes.\n       This is normal. You will have access to the system/private folders.\n\n       Step 5: Use the file manager to copy installserver.exe into the\n       c:sysbin folder of your phone. This allows you to install\n       unsigned apps.\n\n       Now Simply send the Unsigned Releases from ErESPDA to your phone\n       and install without any complications. ^_^\n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n                                                                      \n                     - -- --- ----  Group  Info  ---- --- -- -              \n                                                                             \n                                We are looking for                        \n                                                                         \n                 - Crackers for all Operating Systems                 \n                                                                      \n                 - Quality suppliers                                 \n                                                                      \n                 - Good 100Mbit+ EU &amp; Asia Sites to affil with       \n                                                                        \n                 - Anything else you think we might like              \n                                                                       \n                       e r e s p d a  a t  g m a i l . c o m            \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n    \n     - \u0015  i i -b  -p   K - R  M -t H  -w  R L D -o F -1 3 3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1845cf02d657a2bf3dc33dc62ca4bd21e49dfea7","amp;dn":"Fingertip.Access.SmartProfile.v4.0.1.S60v3.SymbianOS9.1.Unsigned","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1845cf02d657a2bf3dc33dc62ca4bd21e49dfea7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,69,207,2,214,87,162,191,61,195,61,198,44,164,189,33,228,157,254,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
