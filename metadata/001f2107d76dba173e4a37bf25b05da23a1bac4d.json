I try to share information\n that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.\n NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as\n information. Do not assume support or endorsement on my\n part of all contents. \n\n Think for yourself!\n To paraphrase the late William Cooper: \n Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing \n until you've researched it yourself.\n\n !! please try some of the other shows I upload too !!\n\n my torrents since 26 Nov 2009:\t\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/sebaygo1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/sebaygo1&lt;/a&gt;\n \n my RSS feed:\t\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/7621f7439b536868ef7a883e0b221961&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/7621f7439b536868ef7a883e0b221961&lt;/a&gt;\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n\n\n==============================\nDeadline Live with Jack Blood is now in its 8th year of broadcasting. With several years of research and comprehensive information gathering, Jack has a serious understanding of how the Global Super Elite do their business, and delivers a daily analysis of world events with satire and a song.\n\nHe understands and decodes the doublespeak, and groupthink of the mainstream media, and outlines the agenda of those who would seek to kill off or enslave the planet. Jack discusses mind control, corporate corruption, the police state, globalism, the United Nations agenda (inalienable rights vs UN privileges), secret societies, government sponsored terrorism, and collectivism vs individual sovereignty.\n\nJack Blood is an activist, an investigative blogger, multimedia artist, and a thought criminal. Deadline Live is an Infusion of music, culture, news du jour, opinions, and reality.\n==============================\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:001f2107d76dba173e4a37bf25b05da23a1bac4d","amp;dn":"Deadline+Live+with+Jack+Blood+-+2010+Feb+16+TU+%5Bsebaygo1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"001f2107d76dba173e4a37bf25b05da23a1bac4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,31,33,7,215,109,186,23,62,74,55,191,37,176,93,162,58,27,172,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
