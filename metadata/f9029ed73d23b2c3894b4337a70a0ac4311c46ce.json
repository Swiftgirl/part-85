It captures video from any attached video input device (for example the built-in iSight camera included in many Macintosh computers), which can then be viewed on another computer over a network or the internet.\n\nThe primary use of RemoteSight is as part of a Mac-based video surveillance system, sending video and audio feeds over a network to a central recording computer. To this end it integrates seamlessly with SecuritySpy, our flagship video surveillance software product.\n\nRemoteSight can also be used as a standalone application for remotely monitoring anything happening on or around a particular computer, effectively turning the computer's camera into a network camera that can be viewed in a web browser such as Safari.\n\nThe feature list is as follows:\n--&gt; Streams video and audio via the built-in web server\n--&gt; Supports most Macintosh-compatible cameras and audio input devices\n--&gt; Screen capture\n--&gt; Runs in the background with low CPU usage\n--&gt; Integrates seamlessly with SecuritySpy\n--&gt; Supports both JPEG and MPEG-4 video streaming formats\n--&gt; Remote management of settings via the web interface\n\nWhat's New?\n--&gt; Fixed web server authentication problem\n\nInstallation:\n--&gt; Open folder &amp; mount dmg\n--&gt; Drag app to your applications folder\n--&gt; Program is already cracked! No need to register!\n--&gt; Done!\n\nENJOY!! \n--&gt; IsolatedSoul5591\n\n*Fixed Preferences (Save Button)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9029ed73d23b2c3894b4337a70a0ac4311c46ce","amp;dn":"RemoteSight+v1.0.2+%28Fixed%29+%5BIsolatedSoul5591%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9029ed73d23b2c3894b4337a70a0ac4311c46ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,2,158,215,61,35,178,195,137,75,67,55,167,10,10,196,49,28,70,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
