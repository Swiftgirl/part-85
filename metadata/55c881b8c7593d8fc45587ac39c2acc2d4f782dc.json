As Pioneer 2 arrives to continue the settlement of this new world, contact is lost following a massive explosion on the surface. Players take on the role of a Hunter, Ranger, or Force user, commissioned by the Governor-General to resolve the mystery unfolding on Ragol. And that is just the beginning; starting June 23, SEGA will unveil Episode IV ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ an original storyline featuring all-new content. Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst is a network-based RPG featuring real-time action and communication between players over the internet.\n\nUnlike its predecessors, Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst introduces server-based storage of player data, thereby freeing players from being confined to playing from any single PC/location. A new team system, enhanced character graphics, and better game controls are some of the other improvements introduced in the continuing evolution of the PSO world. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55c881b8c7593d8fc45587ac39c2acc2d4f782dc","amp;dn":"PSO+BB+with+my+custom+interface","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55c881b8c7593d8fc45587ac39c2acc2d4f782dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,200,129,184,199,89,61,143,196,85,135,172,57,194,172,194,212,247,130,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
