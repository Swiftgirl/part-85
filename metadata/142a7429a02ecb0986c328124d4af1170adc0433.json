They are not DVD version, all though some of them are DVD rips.  This is a collection of past and current documentaries presenting alternative up-to-date news.  They are some of what I consider to be the most important and most informative documentaries on issues that are rarely discussed.  These are data discs, meaning that you can only run them on your PC.  You may use a conversion program (listed below) in order to convert them to DVD format if you wish.  All I ask is that you redistribute these discs freely to as many as you can afford, for as you probably already know, time is of the essence.  Please make note of and watch CODEX ALIMENTARIUS by Ian Cane firstly.  Also, FOOD INC., CHEMTRAIL FILMS, and WORLD ACCORDING TO MONSANTO are others to take note of.  This agenda has been around for years, but is just now being put into place, and it is very important for everyone, everywhere to understand all of this.  I have placed the files into separate discs and separate downloads, however, you may choose to download them all at once if you wish.  The above listed documentaries may not necessarily be on the current disc/download you have.  All of these files can be found at isohunt.com as well as others under the search terms NWO 2009 UP-TO-DATE. Enjoy, and again please redistribute freely.\n\n\nNote: You can download all of these programs by simply clicking on and/or copying and pasting the links to the address bar in your browser\n\nRecommended Conversion Program\nXilisoft Video Converter Ultimate - http://torrents.thepiratebay.se/5091144/Xilisoft_Video_Converter_Ultimate_v5.1.26.Build.0904.Multilingua.5091144.TPB.torrent\nXilisoft Video Converter allows you to convert almost any and all video format files from one to another.  Best program on the market.\n\n\nRecommended Media Player\nVLC Media Player ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ http://ftp.free.org/mirrors/videolan/vlc/1.0.3/win32/vlc-1.0.3-win32.exe\nVLC Media Player is probably the best and most popular media player available.  It is free and has many features that are not available in other media players.  It will also play just about any video file format that would not normally play on other media players.\n\n\nVideo Codecs (if needed)\nDivx Codec download - http://www.divx.com/en/downloads/divx\nXvid codec download - http://download.divxmovies.com/XviD-1.2.2-07062009.exe\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:142a7429a02ecb0986c328124d4af1170adc0433","amp;dn":"NWO+Up-To-Date+Disc+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"142a7429a02ecb0986c328124d4af1170adc0433","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,42,116,41,160,46,203,9,134,195,40,18,77,74,241,23,10,220,4,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
