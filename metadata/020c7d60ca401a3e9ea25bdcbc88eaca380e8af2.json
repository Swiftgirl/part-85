It's based on the unremarkable children's cartoon of the same name, which would be indistinguishable from the numerous other post-Powerpuff Girls action comedy cartoons out there were it not for the way it also clumsily cops a broadly Asian theme that ranges from old kung-fu movies to Dragon Ball Z. Uninspired source material aside, Xiaolin Showdown is still a crummy excuse for a four-player, arena-based brawler that's weighed down by a poorly realized lock-on system, crushingly monotonous enemy designs, and crude visuals.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:020c7d60ca401a3e9ea25bdcbc88eaca380e8af2","amp;dn":"Xiaolin+Showdown+%5BPS2%5D+%5BPAL%5D+%5BMULTI5%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"020c7d60ca401a3e9ea25bdcbc88eaca380e8af2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,12,125,96,202,64,26,62,158,162,91,220,188,136,234,202,56,14,138,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
