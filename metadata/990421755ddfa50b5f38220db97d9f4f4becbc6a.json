Accompanied by electric guitar and mandolin runs, the song finds the narrator addressing a former lover who has showed up at his door. He tells her that, although she is &quot;passing through to claim [her] lost-and-found&quot;, he has forgotten about her, and is not open to her forgiveness. This sentiment is explained in the chorus:\n\n    &quot;I've been doin' fine without you\n    Forgettin' all the love we once knew\n    Girl, I ain't the one who slammed that door\n    Now you say you've changed your thinkin'\n    But I ain't got a heart for breakin'\n    So go and pick your bags up off my floor\n    'Cause love don't live here anymore&quot;\n\nThe song's music video was filmed and released in December 2007.\n\nKelley describes the song as follows: &quot;I really felt like we found our sound on this song, and I was really proud that it became our first single since it was one of the first songs that the three of us wrote together.&quot;\n\nAt the 51st Grammy Awards, &quot;Love Don't Live Here&quot; received a nomination for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.
