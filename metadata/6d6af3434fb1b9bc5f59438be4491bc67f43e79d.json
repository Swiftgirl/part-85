He is both a solo artist and collaborator.\n\n[Feb 2010] Artist Statement (about 'The Vibrations Run Deep')- &quot;I've been writing and recording music since around 2000, both with others and alone. This is my first public release, and the first thing that more than myself and maybe five people have heard. During my time of recording, I haven't really let anyone hear most of what I've been doing. Now I'm going to continue releasing things as they happen and from the past.&quot;\n\n&quot;I do not believe in record labels or the music business.  Music is not to be bought or sold, and it certainly cannot be controlled.  Music flows through, into and out of every single one of us.  Nowadays, people have the ability to create music on there own, without spending a fortune in recording studios and signing contracts that give over the rights to their lives.  This future is now and musicians like me are all around you.  Welcome to a label-free world!&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d6af3434fb1b9bc5f59438be4491bc67f43e79d","amp;dn":"Greg+Hampton+-+The+Vibrations+Run+Deep+%282010%29+320+tpb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d6af3434fb1b9bc5f59438be4491bc67f43e79d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,106,243,67,79,177,185,188,95,89,67,139,228,73,27,198,127,67,231,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
