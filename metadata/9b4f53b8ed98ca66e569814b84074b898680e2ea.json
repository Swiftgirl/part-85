Probably best described as Alternative, Experimental or Avante Garde. Their music has a Gothic feel and contains elements of Rockabilly/Psychobilly. Apparently they were obsessed with 50's B-Movies and it shows.\n'When Father Papered the Parlour' is a cover of an old Music Hall song. This, and 'The Gong Man' were played quite a lot in British Alternative Clubs in the mid to late 80's. I used to dance to it although, listening to it now, I can't think how - I was probably drunk.\n\n.mp3 files, 128 kbps\nAll files accurately tagged with Artist, Album Title, Year, Track Number, Genre, Title &amp; Source(in 'comments')\n\nI don't have my computer on 24hrs so downloading may be a little on/off until there are others to seed but I try to have my computer switched on for at least a few hours each day so please persevere - thanks.\n\nI do keep an eye on my torrents, so if it's not working properly, please do leave a comment and I will try to fix it.\n\n\nSong Listing\n\n1 AG 1\n2 Mummy, You're A Wreck\n3 When Father Papered The Parlour\n4 The Gong Man\n5 AG 2\n6 Where's The Rest Of Me?
