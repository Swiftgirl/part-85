I've been working hard on my latest themed house mix.....here it is ready for your pleasure.  This is by far my personal best and I had a lot of fun putting it together.  Chose this theme due to one particular Ticon house track I stumbled across so the the theme should be no surprise.  The selection of new house tracks out in the last couple months has been insane. This is by far my tightest most complicated mix to date so I hope you enjoy it.  \n\nThere are a few stand-out tracks in my opinion such as the Ticon, Neil Quigley, Black Project, and Filo &amp; Peri tracks.  I also threw in a little dub-step breakdown at the halfway point just to slow it down a bit before the next build up.  If you haven't heard it go and find the new MJ Cole - Sincere remix by Nero.....you won't regret it.  A lot of editing and customisation went into almost every track as I try to make all my mixes unique.  Anyway enough for now......sit back, turn it up and enjoy.  See you soon.\n\n\nCheers,\n\nn.a.K. \n\n(You can download all my house mixes at musicthroughscience d0t com)\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n\nIntro ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Tower that are People........Money isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t real\nButch - Disco Shhh (Original Mix)\nFilo &amp; Peri Ft.
