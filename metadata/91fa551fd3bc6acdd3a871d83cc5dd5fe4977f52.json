Demand for food is expected to \n       double within the next 40 years. Yet we can only grow food on four \n       per cent of the earth's surface, the climate is changing and \n       resources like water and fuel are under threat. Jimmy meets the \n       men and women who claim to have new techniques and new \n       technologies that will help meet these challenges.\n       \n       Jimmy starts his journey in the giant of South America - Brazil. \n       He discovers how to turn poisoned land into a powerhouse of world \n       food production, joins sugar cane cutters to see how Brazil has \n       replaced half of all its petrol use with biofuel, and finds a way \n       to save Caiman alligators from poachers. In the Amazon, Jimmy meets \n       an unlikely cattle rancher who claims he can save the rainforest.\n       \n\n\n                             Big up all scene massive!\n\n\n    \n                                       \n                GROUP  INFORMATION          \n         9 Years of the Force and still    \n                      going strong                  \n     \n\n           What we are looking for:\n\n           * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n           * 100mbit or gigabit archive sites for TV/XVID/ETC\n           * 1080p or 720p rippers pre retail or classics\n           * Fios cappers in u.s\n           * U.K or Pre Retail Dvdrippers\n           * Internal 100mbit 1tb+ dump sites for Exlusive group usage\n           * If you think you can help contact us on irc\n           * or email us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d99fb6abbabc99b1acaab1f7b8b0&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91fa551fd3bc6acdd3a871d83cc5dd5fe4977f52","amp;dn":"Jimmys.Global.Harvest.S01E01.720p.HDTV.x264-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91fa551fd3bc6acdd3a871d83cc5dd5fe4977f52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,250,85,31,211,188,106,205,211,168,113,216,60,197,221,95,228,151,127,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
