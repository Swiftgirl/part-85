There are &quot;special someones&quot; in your life who expect to receive romantic gifts from their lovers. Commercialism has put a tremendous amount of pressure on men to give their lovers a romantic day with all the trimmings. Women are under pressure to have a man, or they feel desperate and unloved. Valentines Day follows the lives of several couples during this day. Their stories are told through the interconnections they have with each other. Some will find romance in their relationship, and others will feel the heartbreak of ending a relationship. In this Russian roulette world of finding love, everyone in the film is asking for advice on how to find and keep true love. Douglas Young (the-movie-guy) \n\nSorry this isn't the DVD rip! If I find it i'll post it up!\n\nTHIS IS A CAM RIP.\n\nNot sure what language, I downloaded it from a warez site and because I thought it would be nice sharing I am. It's not english or french!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20890f7c63530aed11eb18314771cd12a6e784e3","amp;dn":"Valentine%5C%27s+Day+%5B+2010+%5D+--+CAM.RIP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20890f7c63530aed11eb18314771cd12a6e784e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,137,15,124,99,83,10,237,17,235,24,49,71,113,205,18,166,231,132,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
