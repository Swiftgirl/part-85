Hypnotic flutes, guitars, and harmonies float over simple but catchy beats, creating a dreamy, nearly Eastern-influenced ambience on songs like &quot;Locked Groove&quot; and &quot;Half Court Press,&quot; while &quot;Par 5&quot; and &quot;Mama's Lamp&quot; wear their '60s folk, soul, and pop influences proudly. While individual songs tend to blend together, Kitty Craft's sound is so distinctive that it makes the album almost like a vacation to a mellow, cheerful, sunny place -- the flower patch itself, perhaps? Unabashedly pretty, ethereal yet down-to-earth, Breaks and Beats From the Flower Patch is a completely charming album.\nAllmusic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efc4cd63cad2495841a494c6f62878afc0ae76b0","amp;dn":"Kitty+Craft+-+Beats+And+Breaks+From+The+Flower+Patch+%281998%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efc4cd63cad2495841a494c6f62878afc0ae76b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,196,205,99,202,210,73,88,65,164,148,198,246,40,120,175,192,174,118,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
