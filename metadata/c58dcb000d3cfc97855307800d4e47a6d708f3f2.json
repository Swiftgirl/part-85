She becomes an artist's model and the toast of Paris, attracting the attention of Picasso-like painter Julien Mistral, an arrogant and selfish man who places his work above everything. Their paths diverge as Mistral's art catches the eye of a rich American woman who becomes his patroness and eventually his wife. During the war years in France, Mistral collaborates with the Nazis in order to continue with his work, a decision that will come back to haunt him years later. In the meantime, Maggy has a daughter named Teddy who grows up and falls in love with Mistral with whom she has a child named Fauve. As Mistral ages, he comes to terms with his selfish past and wartime betrayal through his art, leaving a beautiful legacy for his daughter, Fauve.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c58dcb000d3cfc97855307800d4e47a6d708f3f2","amp;dn":"Mistral%5C%27s+Daughter+Part1+%281984%29+-+Stefanie+Powers.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c58dcb000d3cfc97855307800d4e47a6d708f3f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,141,203,0,13,60,252,151,133,83,7,128,13,78,71,166,215,8,243,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
