It was released as the fourth and final single from the band's tenth studio album Brigade.\n\nThe track is a rock power ballad which did not meet with much mainstream success, peaking at number sixty-four on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and number seventy-nine on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nA very emotional song, it portrays forbidden love and the tragedy that the situation is. Ann's voice shows power as usual but above all a sincerity which is unrivaled by many of her fellow performers. The communication in this power-ballad is often linked to the still on and off relationship Ann maintains with ex-guitarist Michael Fisher.\n\nBrigade is the tenth album released by the popular rock/pop band Heart. Released in 1990 after a three year gap between albums, the album reached number three on the U.S. Billboard 200, and was followed by a successful tour.\n\nHeart is a rock band whose founding members came from Seattle, Washington, USA in the early 1970s. Going through several lineup changes, the only constant members of the group are sisters Ann and Nancy Wilson. The group rose to fame in the 1970s with their music being influenced by hard rock as well as folk music. After diminishing in popularity by the mid-1980s, the band created a major comeback in 1985, experiencing further success with their power ballads throughout the rest of the decade. By the mid-1990s, Heart left their 1980s' sound and went back to their hard rock roots which they continue to play today. They have sold over 30 million albums worldwide.\n\nHeart was ranked #57 on VH1's &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot;.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d12e994735361623acbe86e14459274dfc78339","amp;dn":"Heart+-+Secret++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d12e994735361623acbe86e14459274dfc78339","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,18,233,148,115,83,97,98,58,203,232,110,20,69,146,116,223,199,131,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
