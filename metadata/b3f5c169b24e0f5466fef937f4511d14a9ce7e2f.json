With the Antarctic winter drawing close, Carrie must work diligently to complete the investigation before the arrival of an incoming storm. Carrie is unaware that she is involved in a sixty year old murder that the killer would do anything to keep secret. While working on the case, Stetko crosses paths with an UN operative (Gabriel Macht), who has also been assigned to the case as an investigator. As Stetko chases down suspects, she finds evidence of more murders. Stetko is maliciously attacked by the killer and left for dead in the harsh Antarctic storm.

The studio cast Reese Witherspoon to star in Whiteout, which would be based on the screenplay written by the Hoebers.[9] By May 2004, a second draft of the script had been written, and a director was still being sought.[10] Ultimately, rights over the film changed ownership, detaching Witherspoon from the project.[11]\n\nIn October 2006, Whiteout entered development at Dark Castle Entertainment with production slated to begin in the coming winter for a release date in the first quarter of 2008.[12] Dominic Sena, a fan of the graphic novel since its '98 debut, had sought to acquire the rights to direct a film adaptation, and when rights were acquired by Dark Castle, Sena petitioned to producer Joel Silver, president of the company, for the opportunity to direct Whiteout.[13] In February 2007, with Warner Bros. signed on to distribute Whiteout, Sena was hired to direct the film, based on the adapted screenplay by the Hoebers. In the same month, Beckinsale was cast in the lead role.[4] Production began on March 5, 2007 in Manitoba, with later footage being shot in Montreal.[14] A set was also constructed on the shore of Lake Winnipeg.[15] The film was primarily set in a bright world of ice and sunlight, an unconventional approach to the murder mystery genre. Both real and fake snow were used in production. The author of the graphic novel, Greg Rucka, applauded the film adaptation of his source material. Filming concluded a few weeks before Comic-Con in July 2007.[5]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3f5c169b24e0f5466fef937f4511d14a9ce7e2f","amp;dn":"Whiteout+2009+HD2DVD+NTSC+DTS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3f5c169b24e0f5466fef937f4511d14a9ce7e2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,245,193,105,178,78,15,84,102,254,249,55,244,81,29,20,169,206,126,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
