Since this time many web pages have updated their pages to follow the bbc, imdb has not at the time of writing this nfo.\n\nSo what we are going to do is this, complete the current run as is, then issue a dirfix for the complete set of current eps, knowing the bbc and others they will probably at some point in the future change the labelling again anyway just to confuse things even more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f607abde13860c47ab72bf74d777fe371ace362d","amp;dn":"Shaun+The+Sheep+S03E19+720p+HDTV+READ+NFO+x264-SFM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f607abde13860c47ab72bf74d777fe371ace362d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,7,171,222,19,134,12,71,171,114,191,116,215,119,254,55,26,206,54,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
