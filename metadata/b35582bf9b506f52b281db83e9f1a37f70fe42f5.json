It's done!  My third themed mix of the year.  It's been a crazy year for me which has slowed me down a bit but with new equipment and software on the horizon things are looking exciting.\n\nI've wanted to do a Blade Runner theme mix for awhile now so here it is.  One of my favourite movies and soundtracks of all time so I hope you enjoy the tribute! As always all editing and mixing is by me completed in a single take.  Some sick tracks here.  Starts off a bit slow but quickly builds a nice beat.  \n\nEnjoy! \nn.a.K. \n\nYou can download all of my house mixes on my website at musicthroughscience d0t com\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n\n1.\tIntro - Meet Your Maker........... \n2.\tPryda ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Alfon (Original Mix)                                                                                 \n3.\tDaft Punk - Harder Better Faster Stronger (Deadmau5 Edit)                           \n4.\tThe Presets ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Steamworks                                                                                     \n5.\tFunkagenda and Mark Knight - Flauta Magica (Original Mix)                       \n6.\tNeuroxyde, Doomwork - Jazzy Stuff (Original Mix)                                          \n7.\tJoris Voorn - Chase the Mouse (Original Mix)                                                  \n8.\tAlex Gopher - Motorcycle (Wet Clutch Edit)                                                     \n9.\tFUKKK OFFF - More than Friends                                                                     \n10.\tSantiago, Bushido, Colette - Make Me Feel (Original Mix)                 \n11.\tUppermost - Funk (Original Mix)                                                                         \n12.\tSergio Fernandez - Unforgettable Summer (2010 Vision Main Mix)                  \n13.\tDeadmau5 - Moar Ghosts N Stuff - Ghosts 'n Stuff (featuring Rob Swire) (n.a.K. edit)\n14.\tTom Budden - The Tree Dance                                                                            \n15.\tCirez D - On Off (Original Mix)                                                                             \n16.\tOutro - IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve Seen Things..........                                                                                    \n\nTotal Track Time                                                                                                                         \n1:18:04          \n\n\nTrack Info\n\n320kbps MP3\n48000Hz\nStereo\n      \n\nCheers,\n\nn.a.K.\n\nmusicthroughscience d0t com\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b35582bf9b506f52b281db83e9f1a37f70fe42f5","amp;dn":"n.a.K.+House+Mix+V+-+A+Blade+Runner+House+Mix+%28XXX-X-MMIX%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b35582bf9b506f52b281db83e9f1a37f70fe42f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,85,130,191,155,80,111,82,178,129,219,131,233,241,163,127,112,254,66,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
