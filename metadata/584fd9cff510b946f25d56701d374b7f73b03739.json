Join the club of Farmville Masters!\n\nNeed more reasons to fall in love with this application? keep reading...\n\n\nIn this game, the best way to level up and get money is to be constantly planting and harvesting seeds. In fact, the best way to level up is to plant seeds that get ready in a very short time, so that you can get all the experience points very quickly.\n\n\nHowever, every time your seeds are ready, the same boring and repetitive tasks have to be accomplished. This involves picking up every fruit, plowing the terrain and planting seeds again. When you start evolving in this game, so does your farm, and you will find yourself expanding it early from the beginning. The average number of arable squares in a player's farm is between 300 and 400. After a while, clicking 1200 times in the screen (400*3) every time your seeds are ready starts to be just too much. If you consider you also have to click in every animal and tree from time to time, the situation is even worse! Even with new additions such as the tractor and the harvester, you still only plant 4 squares at a time and are highly dependable on fuel, which can only be bought with the special notes.\n\n                     Alternative Sources To Download  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.m*gaupload.com/?d=QY4PAERL&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.m*gaupload.com/?d=QY4PAERL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.idanny.biz/Farmville%20Extreme%20Manager%203.73%20By%20iD@nny%20!.rar&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.idanny.biz/Farmville%20Extreme%20Manager%203.73%20By%20iD@nny%20!.rar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.m*diafire.com/?etqzodnmkcz&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.m*diafire.com/?etqzodnmkcz&lt;/a&gt;\n\nReplace the * with an e","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:584fd9cff510b946f25d56701d374b7f73b03739","amp;dn":"Farming+Extreme+Manager+3.73+%28FarmVille+Bot%29+%2B+Crack+By+iD%40nny+%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"584fd9cff510b946f25d56701d374b7f73b03739","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,79,217,207,245,16,185,70,242,93,86,112,29,55,75,127,115,176,55,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
