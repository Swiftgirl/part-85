Lost has never had an episode under 40min.\n\nSo while we appreciate people rushing to release half a show, all it does is\ncause people to waste their bandwidth downloading the same thing 1.5 times and \ndelays the release of the second part thus making people even more angry.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efeb5321e4bad147b3f320bd685ab5348d0f8805","amp;dn":"Lost.S06E01-E02.PROPER.720p.HDTV.x264-2HD.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efeb5321e4bad147b3f320bd685ab5348d0f8805","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,235,83,33,228,186,209,71,179,243,32,189,104,90,181,52,141,15,136,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
