The single was released on May 25, 2009 and released with the album on Jule 14, 2009.\n\nThe song was co-written by every member of the band. Alison Mosshart told Mojo magazine about the writing process of the band: &quot;Everybody just did what they wanted. I wrote most of the lyrics because that's my favorite thing, and everybody wrote different parts to the music- someone would lead with something and I'd be writing furiously, and within an hour we'd have something good enough to record or work on. It was super-easy and super-quick.&quot; \n\nA short film was made in support of the single. It was directed by Jonathan Glazer.\n\nThe video features drummer Jack White and lead vocalist Alison Mosshart walking across an open field outside of a suburban neighbourhood carrying automatic weapons and dressed in black leather jackets. They then proceed to fire at each other, hitting each other many times but neither appears to feel any impact. The video ends when Mosshart and White run out of ammunition and White proceeds to leave, walking off into the sunset.\n\nThe video was also rated 1st in the top 50 videos of 2009 by NME on NME TV, in the UK.\n\nThe single fared decently on the US and UK charts. It peaked at #40 on &quot;Hot Modern Rock Tracks&quot; and at #168 on the &quot;UK Singles Chart.&quot;\n\nHorehound is the debut studio album by American rock band The Dead Weather. It was released on July 10 in Australia, July 13 in Europe, and July 14, 2009 in North America. The album was recorded at Third Man Studios during a three week session in January 2009. The first single from the album, &quot;Hang You from the Heavens&quot;, was released through iTunes on March 11, 2009, and on vinyl on April 18, 2009. &quot;Treat Me Like Your Mother&quot; was released as the second single from the album on May 25, 2009. The third single from the album is set to be &quot;I Cut Like a Buffalo&quot; and will include a cover of The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band's &quot;A Child of a Few Hours is Burning to Death&quot; as a B-side. The album debuted at #6 on the U.S. Billboard 200 Album Charts and at #14 on the UK Album Charts.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca0cebdd126c02685cff01b4d55aee357ac62493","amp;dn":"The+Dead+Weather+-+Treat+Me+Like+Your+Mother+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca0cebdd126c02685cff01b4d55aee357ac62493","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,12,235,221,18,108,2,104,92,255,1,180,213,90,238,53,122,198,36,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
