Rowling, chart Harry's progress as he discovers his magical powers, meets his soon-to-be two best friends, learns how to play the school sport, Quidditch, and begins to understand how the forces that killed his parents are still out to do him harm. In the sixth thrilling instalment, Harry returns to Hogwarts for another year of schooling and learns more about the dark past of the boy who grew up to become his arch nemesis, Lord Voldemort. While trying to thwart Voldemort's evil plans and save both the Muggle and wizarding worlds from imminent disaster, Harry is struck by the love bug that seems to be going around Hogwarts. Fortunately, Dumbledore, his trusty mentor, is on hand to prepare him for the monumental battle that's looming ever closer.\n\nActors\n    Ralph Fiennes\n    Rupert Grint\n    Gary Oldman\n    Katie Leung\n    Bonnie Wright\n    James Phelps\n    Emma Watson\n    Estelle Harris\n    Emma Thompson\n    Robbie Jarvis\n    Fiona Shaw\n    Daniel Radcliffe\n    Helena Bonham-Carter\n    Jason Isaacs\n    Maggie Smith\n    Michael Gambon\n    Alan Rickman\n    Natalie Tena\n    David Thewlis\n    Chris Rankin\n    Richard Harris\n    Brendan Gleeson\n    Julie Walters\n    Evanna Lynch\n    Robbie Coltrane\n    Warwick Davis\n    Mark Williams\n    Matthew Lewis\n    Kenneth Branagh\n    Richard Griffiths\n    Tom Felton\n    Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â« less\nDirector\n    Alfonso Cuaron\n    Chris Columbus\n    David Yates\n    Mike Newell\nLanguage\n    English\nNumber of Files\n    6\nStudio\n    WARNER BROS\nFilm Rating (Australia)\n    M\nFilm Rating (UK)\n    12\nMedia Format\n    Blu-ray\nRun Time (minutes)\n    903\nCast &amp; Crew\n    J.K.
