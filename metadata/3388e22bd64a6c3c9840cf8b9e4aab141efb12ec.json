Itsy Bitsy Tittie Girl\n\nDeadsy was initially signed to Sire Records which was distributed by Warner Brothers. They actually recorded two albums for the label, the first self-titled and the second named &quot;Commencement&quot;, but neither saw release. Both are circulating, but actual promotional copies of &quot;Commencement&quot; were produced and distributed to promote it's then impending release. Sire, unfortunately, lost their distribution deal with Warners which led to Deadsy gaining release from their contract. Because of close affiliations with Orgy and Korn the band was able to secure a deal with Korn's Elementree Records and distribution with Dreamworks and in 2002, a revised version of &quot;Commencement&quot; with several new tracks was released.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDeadsy - Commencement\nRELEASED: 2002\n\n\nTracks:\n01.

This is the official release of the album, distributed through Dreamworks Records under the Elementree sub-label. The album contains two cover songs: &quot;Brand New Love&quot; written by Lou Barlow of the band Sebadoh and &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; written by Rush. The album also contains guest appearances by Jonathan Davis of Korn fame, Troy Van Leeuwen (Failure, A Perfect Circle, Queens of the Stone Age), and John Taylor (Duran Duran). The album failed to generate the projected sales goals and in no time Elementree folded.

The album debuted at #176 in the Billboard Top 200 charts. Phantasmagore had been delayed numerous times since its original release date in 2004, citing label issues and overall complications. A video shoot for the original choice for first single, &quot;Book of Black Dreams&quot; was planned for June, but had to be rescheduled, and was later canceled when director Kenneth Anger actually heard the band's music. The official first single slated for release is 'Carrying Over', which will be released in two forms, the album version, and the acoustic version from the Family Values 2006 compilation album..\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDeadsy - Unsorted\n\nDreamcatcher\nAntipop\nAsura (Demo)\nBabes In The Abyss (Demo)\nSleepy Hollow\nReplicas\nThis Goodnight\nTom Sawyer (Live)\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3388e22bd64a6c3c9840cf8b9e4aab141efb12ec","amp;dn":"Deadsy+-+Abrasax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3388e22bd64a6c3c9840cf8b9e4aab141efb12ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,136,226,43,214,74,108,60,152,64,207,139,158,74,171,20,30,251,18,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
