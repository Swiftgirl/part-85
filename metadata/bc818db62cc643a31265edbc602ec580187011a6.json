The only consistent pattern \nto the crimes involves the perpetrators calm admissions of guilt, explaining,\n &quot;God told me to.&quot; While investigating the murders, catholic police detective \nPeter Nicholas (Tony Lo Bianco) is increasingly troubled by evidence of a \nChrist-like figure named Bernard Phillips (Richard Lynch) who appeared to each\nof the killers and can't seem to shake the feeling that his own fate is somewhat\nlinked to this mysterious being. As he comes closer to the truth, his worst \nfears are confirmed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc818db62cc643a31265edbc602ec580187011a6","amp;dn":"God.Told.Me.To.1976.LDRip.XviD-Movieboys","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc818db62cc643a31265edbc602ec580187011a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,129,141,182,44,198,67,163,18,101,237,188,96,46,197,128,24,112,17,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
