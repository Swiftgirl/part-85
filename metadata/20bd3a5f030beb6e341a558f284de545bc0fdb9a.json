Thankfully, Montreal's Humanifesto, while overtly political, bring some real ruckus to accompany the politics on their debut disc. And if that wasn't enough, they take a monstrous shot at overzealous and sometimes-embarrassing lefties like Moore (Michael Moron), proving that these guys don't feel the need to thrash along party lines.\n\n1.
