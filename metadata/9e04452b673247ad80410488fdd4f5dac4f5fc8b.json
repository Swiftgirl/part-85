They \nare by far the best metal band in Hawaii. \nI am stationed in Hawaii in the military\nnow. But when I leave here I still want to\nbe able to see them back in New York.\n\nBest drum chops ever, guitar shreds, and\npowerful vox. I would compare them to a\nmix between Lamb of God and The Faceless.\n\nThey can do Black Dahlia Murder and other great covers and sound flawless.  I was\nvery impressed and grabbed this demo at\none their shows in Honolulu.\n\nBest melodic death metal I ever heard.\nBest live performance I seen in years.\nRecord labels need to swarm in on these\nguys.\n\nAnyone out there that can help them out? Please re-seed and re-upload this torrent\nso BEFORE FIRE gets the exposure they \ndeserve.\n\n\nmyspace . com / beforefireofficial","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e04452b673247ad80410488fdd4f5dac4f5fc8b","amp;dn":"BEFORE+FIRE+-+demo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e04452b673247ad80410488fdd4f5dac4f5fc8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,4,69,43,103,50,71,173,128,65,4,136,253,212,245,218,196,245,252,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
