When we are consuming knowledge, our mind operates in a predominantly alpha brainwave. This meditation uses the alpha brainwave tuned to 13.82687 cycles per second.\n\nTapping into the third eye chakra, this meditation tunes itself to this chakra. This results in a meditation that can engage the mind and sharpen our attention to the subject at hand.\n\nIn our society, consuming enormous amounts of information has become a requirement. This meditation has been designed to assist people in consuming these large amounts of data.\n\nSuggested Use: Can be used for deep focus on subject matter that requires memory. Can also be used during work to enhance focus of daily activities. \n\nI like it so I thought you might too. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.meditationdna.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.meditationdna.com&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e520fa77381af7349beeaf7b0a5fc4c020a8e70","amp;dn":"Focused+Learning","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e520fa77381af7349beeaf7b0a5fc4c020a8e70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,82,15,167,115,129,175,115,73,190,234,247,176,165,252,76,2,10,142,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
