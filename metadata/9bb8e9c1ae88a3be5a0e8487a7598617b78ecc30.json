Bon Jovi's more-than-passing flirtation with spaghetti-western imagery that ends with the hero riding off into the sunset is evident on songs like Stick to Your Guns, Ride Cowboy Ride, and Wild Is the Wind. Stadium anthems like Bad Medicine and Lay Your Hands on Me showed that the band really knew how to have a good time. New Jersey is by far Bon Jovi's best album ever.\n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 8\nArtist: Bon Jovi\nAlbum: New Jersey\nYear: 1988\nGenre: Rock\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bb8e9c1ae88a3be5a0e8487a7598617b78ecc30","amp;dn":"Bon+Jovi+-+New+Jersey+%5BFLAC-1988%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bb8e9c1ae88a3be5a0e8487a7598617b78ecc30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,184,233,193,174,136,163,190,90,14,132,135,167,89,134,23,183,142,204,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
