Air's Jean-BenoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â®t Dunckel and Nicolas Godin (who paid tribute to Serge Gainsbourg particularly well on 10,000 Hz Legend's &quot;Wonder Milky Bitch&quot;) wrote 5:55's delicate music, while Jarvis Cocker and the Divine Comedy's Neil Hannon penned its lyrics. This mingling of French and English influences is mirrored in Gainsbourg's subtly expressive voice and accent, which provides the perfect complement to the album's lush sounds and vivid imagery. On &quot;AF607105&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the most Air-like song here ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ she's a stewardess recounting the most glamorous plane crash ever; she performs an autopsy on a relationship on &quot;The Operation,&quot; finally stating that &quot;the heart was rejected by the host.&quot; As good as the atmospheric heartache of the first half of 5:55 is, it's on the second half, when Gainsbourg and her crew stretch out a bit, that the album really gets interesting. &quot;Jamais,&quot; a slightly tough, witty cautionary tale about literally acting like you're in love, is a standout, while the sexy, obsessive &quot;Beauty Mark&quot; and &quot;Everything I Cannot See&quot; would make her father proud.\n\n1. 5:55\n2.
