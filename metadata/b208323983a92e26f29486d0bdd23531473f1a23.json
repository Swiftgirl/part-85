As the first single from their second album, Hold Your Fire, the song reached #83 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #27 on the Mainstream Rock charts. The song was written by guitarist Bill Leverty and vocalist C.J. Snare.\n\nHold Your Fire is the second studio album of the hard rock band FireHouse. It was released in June 1992. The album spent thirty weeks in the Billboard 200 Top Albums chart peaking at # 23.\n\nThe album spawned several hit singles like &quot;Reach for the Sky&quot;, &quot;Sleeping With You&quot; and another signature love ballad in the form of &quot;When I Look Into Your Eyes&quot;. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA in the United States. Guitarist Bill Leverty expected the album to become certified Platinum in 2008.\n\nFireHouse is an American hard rock band formed in Charlotte, North Carolina in 1989. The band reached stardom during the early 1990s with hit singles like &quot;Don't Treat Me Bad&quot; and &quot;All She Wrote&quot;, as well as their signature ballads &quot;I Live My Life for You&quot;, &quot;Love of a Lifetime&quot;, and &quot;When I Look Into Your Eyes&quot;. At the 1992 American Music Awards, FireHouse won the award for Best New Hard Rock/Metal Band. They were chosen over Nirvana and Alice in Chains.\n\nDespite diminishing success in the United States as the decade progressed, the band remained very popular in Asia, mainly in countries like Japan, Thailand, and Singapore. FireHouse continued to release new material throughout the late 1990s and into the early 2000s, most of which has successfully charted in Japan. The band has also continued to tour internationally as of 2007, having participated twice in the annual Rock Never Stops Tour with other bands of the 1980s. FireHouse is estimated to have sold 7 million albums worldwide since their debut.\n\nOriginally composed of vocalist C.J. Snare, guitarist Bill Leverty, guitarist Cosby Ellis, drummer Michael Foster, and bassist Perry Richardson, the band has maintained its original members with the exception of Cosby Ellis, who left the band in 1989 after co-writing the multi platinum debut recording and was not replaced, and Richardson, who departed in 2000 due to conflict. Richardson was replaced three times before current bassist Allen McKenzie was given the position in 2004.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b208323983a92e26f29486d0bdd23531473f1a23","amp;dn":"Firehouse+-+Reach+For+The+Sky++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b208323983a92e26f29486d0bdd23531473f1a23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,8,50,57,131,169,46,38,242,148,134,208,189,210,53,49,71,63,26,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
