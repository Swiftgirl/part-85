Hence why I opted to not blur the counter and crop it instead. The timer was on the very bottom and not much is missed with it cropped. I don't..Dont like the timer or the blur if I can help it...Fixed Resolution-Aspect Ratio &amp; Proper for size....\nAlready burned and tested on my standalone DivX player and it turned out sweet.
