Encapsulated in the rather thin plot, about a divorcee wandering the city, this is really a documentary on Los Angeles in 1959, and an amazing one at that. No one who lives here should feel they really know what it was like until they see this film, which includes footage of a New Year's celebration, the roller derby, a wrestling match, a strip club, and yes, the Second Street Tunnel again. - from imdb\n\nProps to the original ripper/upper.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9af9c2ebed565773cdd7c7f82214cdac3cc32b96","amp;dn":"The.Savage.Eye.1960.DVDRip.XviD+-+LA+Street+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9af9c2ebed565773cdd7c7f82214cdac3cc32b96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,249,194,235,237,86,87,115,205,215,199,248,34,20,205,172,60,195,43,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
