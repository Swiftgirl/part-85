This fan film is based on the Batman character created by Bob Kane and on the graphical universe of Franck MillerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Sin City.  Original screenplay by Samuel Bodin and directed by Julien Mokrani &amp; Samuel Bodin.\n\nThe script was almost composed of a 100 pages but Julien only wanted 20 pages. Cutting the script was heartbreak to me. But I did it.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â« Our Batman is not human Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â», Julien explained, Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â« heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a shadow, he wants revenge. His figure is very sharp, vampire-like and rough. The only thing you will recognize from NolanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Batman is his deep and rough voice. MillerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s work (Dark Knight, Sin City) and Dave McKeanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Batman : Arkham Asilum were inspiring to us. We also used the retro style of the Tim SaleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Joker. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â»\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â« HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s kinda like an enormous Nosferatu whom you just canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t define the contours Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â», Samuel added, Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â« a furious divinity if we could say so. And for this we used fishing thread and fabrics! LetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s say we are proud of the result. This happened thanks to the extraordinary work the postproduction team done. Postproduction was a huge part of the project since the major part of this short-film was shot with a green screen. On a visual point of view, we used R.RodriguezÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s work as a background but finally we would use as little 3D as possible and work with 2D solids to be as close as possible of comics universe.  300ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s skies, MignolaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Gotham by Gashlight and hundreds of photos of New-York under the 20ies and 40ies helped us create our Gotham : a city not yet out of the economic crisis in 1939.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â»\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnother awesome independent movie. Very well done and quite fun..\n\nHope you enjoy this movie, and support the creators...\n\nThe movie itself is in .flv format. Why?
