It managed to peak at #38 in the UK charts and #31 on the mainstream rock tracks chart. It was one of three singles released from the album (the other two being &quot;Hey Stoopid&quot; and &quot;Feed My Frankenstein&quot;) that launched &quot;Hey Stoopid&quot; into the top 40.\n\nThe single featured a B-Side, a cover of Jimi Hendrix's &quot;Fire&quot;.\n\nHey Stoopid is a studio album from heavy metal singer and shock rock-musician Alice Cooper. It was released on July 2, 1991 (see 1991 in music) with guest appearances from Slash (of Guns N' Roses), Ozzy Osbourne, Vinnie Moore, Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, Nikki Sixx and Mick Mars (both of MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e).\n\nAfter Cooper's smash 1989 hit album &quot;Trash&quot;, Cooper attempted to retain his success with this album.\n\n    * The final track, &quot;Wind-up Toy&quot;, is the first appearance of fictional character/alter ego Steven in 15 years.\n    * Aside from &quot;Wind-up Toy&quot;, which has an insanity theme, lyrical themes involve strictly drug use/addiction (&quot;Hey Stoopid&quot;, &quot;Snakebite&quot;, &quot;Dangerous Tonight&quot;, &quot;Hurricane Years&quot;) and love/sex (&quot;Love's a Loaded Gun&quot;, &quot;Burning Our Bed&quot;, &quot;Might as Well Be on Mars&quot;, &quot;Feed My Frankenstein&quot;, &quot;Little by Little&quot;, &quot;Die for You&quot;, &quot;Dirty Dreams&quot;).\n    * Music Videos were made for &quot;Hey Stoopid&quot;, &quot;Love's a Loaded Gun&quot;, and &quot;Feed My Frankenstein&quot;. According to the CDs wrapping, &quot;Might as Well Be on Mars&quot; was another intended single. (As it is featured on Greatest Hits compilations.)\n    * References to the album's songs are made on the album's cover, including a diamond Cobra (&quot;Snakebite&quot;), broken glass (&quot;Dangerous Tonight&quot;), spider webs (&quot;Hurricane Years&quot;), and the temptress and her hair from &quot;Dirty Dreams&quot;.\n    * Slash has a guest-appearance, playing the guitar solo in the song &quot;Hey Stoopid.&quot; Over 2 months after this album was released, Cooper collaborated with Slash again - and his band Guns N' Roses on the track &quot;The Garden&quot; from Use Your Illusion I. Cooper also cooperated with Axl Rose to create an updated duet for Alice Cooper's Under My Wheels, which appears on Alice's album, The Life and Crimes of Alice Cooper and also as the finale in the rockumentary The Decline of Western Civilization II: The Metal Years (1988) . Slash also appears as lead guitar in Alice's 2009 release Along Came A Spider\n    * The song &quot;Feed My Frankenstein&quot; were prominently featured in the 1992 film Wayne's World. Wayne and Garth are given tickets and backstage passes to a concert and this song is played. After the song the two met Alice Cooper backstage. When Alice said they could hang out with him and the band, Wayne and Garth dropped to their knees bowing for him and repeating the phrase &quot;We're not worthy&quot;. Alice stated in an interview that during the Hey Stoopid tour a lot of his fans imitated this moment from the movie when they met him.\n    * Alice Cooper teamed up with then-labelmate Ozzy Osbourne in the song &quot;Hey Stoopid.&quot; Ozzy makes a brief appearance in the music video as well. He sings one line, &quot;...you know, I know...&quot;\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef087a972b341f434c0a34bf2e34cbaaf481cbfa","amp;dn":"Alice+Cooper+-+Love%5C%27s+A+Loaded+Gun++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef087a972b341f434c0a34bf2e34cbaaf481cbfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,8,122,151,43,52,31,67,76,10,52,191,46,52,203,170,244,129,203,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
