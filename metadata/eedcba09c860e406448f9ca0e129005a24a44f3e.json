Techno Soft released a variety of game soundtracks, some containing this music, but they're insanely hard to track down and very old now.\n\nAs with my Gunstar Heroes OSV remaster, I have added some sympathetic mastering, made appropriate edits and rearranged the tracklist so that it makes for a better listen as an &quot;album&quot; (watch out for the continuously segued &quot;boss medleys&quot; on III and IV).  This is some of the very best music the Sega Genesis had to offer, and seeing as a few nabbed my Gunstar Heroes torrent I hope you enjoy this as much as I do, it's one of my favourite Sega Genesis soundtracks.\n\nThe readme's follow:\n\n\n---------------\n\n\n\n\n\nTechno Soft - Thunder Force II The Soundtrack (Original Sound Version)\n\nFoobar VGM HQ WAV dumps -&gt; post-processing/mastering by Vertiphon\n\nComposed by Tomomi Ootani.\nCopyright 1989 Techno Soft.\nVertiphon 2010 remaster.\n\n\n01 And The Wind Blew All Day Long (Opening Theme)  0:31\n02 Tan Tan Ta Ta Ta Tan (Game Start)  0:14\n03 Knights Of Legend (Stage 1 - The Skies Overhead Planet Nebula)  2:23\n04 Above Level Complete  0:16\n05 A Ray Of Hope (Stage 2 - Inside An Enemy Port)  3:14\n06 Side Level Complete  0:14\n07 Exceed (Stage 3 - Underground City Skyscrapers)  2:30\n08 Cruise Control (Stage 4 - Highway)  1:39\n09 Take Strict Precautions (Stage 5 - A Cave Deeper Inside The Planet)  2:19\n10 Cloud Of Dust (Stage 6 - An Abandoned Pipe)  2:13\n11 Illusion (Stage 7 - Ancient Ruins &amp; Statues)  3:00\n12 Death Face's (Stage 8 - Inside The Ruins)  2:49\n13 Irrevocable Dream (Stage 9 - The Fortress Plealos)  3:05\n14 Kiyara Boss  0:52\n15 Zoetrope Boss  0:56\n16 Galileo Boss  1:34\n17 Elephant Man Boss  0:56\n18 Humanoid Hunter + Final Boss  1:30\n19 Continue  0:09\n20 Game Over  0:16\n21 Take Off One's Gloves (Ending Theme)  3:35\n\n\n\nThe files are in 24-bit 44.1 kHz lossless FLAC audio format.\n\nThis soundtrack has been created with gapless play in mind.\nDo not add gaps if you burn to a CD as audio.\n\n\n\n\n-------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechno Soft - Thunder Force III The Soundtrack (Original Sound Version)\n\nFoobar VGM HQ WAV dumps -&gt; post-processing/mastering by Vertiphon\n\nComposed by Tomomi Ootani, Toshiharu Yamanishi and Naosuke Arai.\nCopyright 1990 Techno Soft.
