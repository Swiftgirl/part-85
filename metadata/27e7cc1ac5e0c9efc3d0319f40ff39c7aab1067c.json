Knowing exactly where this is headed is, of course, part of the fun in this tongue-in-cheek zombie sequel. Maybe it's not as fresh as its successful predecessor, but all of the key zombie ingredients are still well preserved in this second installment: ravenous &quot;undead&quot; in search of human brains, severed limbs with a life of their own, and lots and lots of shrieking! Taking a hackneyed premise that is a close retelling of part I, director Ken Wiederhorn (FreddyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Nightmares, Shock Waves) rejuvenates the genre with sporadic genuine scares, lots of plain old silliness, and some literally eye-popping special effects.\n\n-------------------\n\nFormat: ISO.\n\nEnglish W/ Optional Subtitles\n\nYear Released: (1988)\n\nThe Untouched DVD Includes All Original Features","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27e7cc1ac5e0c9efc3d0319f40ff39c7aab1067c","amp;dn":"Return_Of_The_Living_Dead_2.ISO+%281988%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27e7cc1ac5e0c9efc3d0319f40ff39c7aab1067c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,231,204,26,197,224,201,239,195,208,49,159,64,255,57,199,170,177,6,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
