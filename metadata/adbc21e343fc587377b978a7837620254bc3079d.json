Most members have             \n           learned to keep their distance, but Sister Thomas is           \n           determined to open Mike s mind to GOD and religion.            \n           Connecting through a love for music she convinces Mike to      \n           pick up the Bible and start reading. He quickly learns         \n           that the Bible truly is a book of songs and slowly starts      \n           to believe in himself again. With the help of Sister           \n           Thomas, Mike stands up to his friends and begins to            \n           choose a more righteous path.                                  \n                                                                          \n                                                    \n                        \n                            \n                                 \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                      \n                      \n                             \n                       \n         \n                                                                        \n                                                                            \n                  Thanks to our friends at KART3LDVD.
