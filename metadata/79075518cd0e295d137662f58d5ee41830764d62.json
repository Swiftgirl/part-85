This is a very interesting performance.  It's good, but what's most interesting is the body language he exhibits towards the sound engineers.  There's a recurrent issue with feedback, on and off, throughout the performance, to which Paco looks towards the sides of the stage like he wants to bludgeon them to death with his guitar.  Funny shit.  Unfortunately, I did not rip this one so the quality is as I received it.  It's just a tad better than your average streamed video.\n\nTime:      1:12:34\nAudio:     64 kbps\nVideo:     25 frames/sec, 316 x 240\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79075518cd0e295d137662f58d5ee41830764d62","amp;dn":"Paco+de+Lucia+%26+Group+-+Bulgaria+1988","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79075518cd0e295d137662f58d5ee41830764d62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,7,85,24,205,14,41,93,19,118,98,245,141,94,228,24,48,118,77,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
