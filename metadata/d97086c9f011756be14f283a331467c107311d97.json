Intro\n2. Stay For Tea\n3. Mud\n4. 7 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8 Inches Of Fist\n5. Under The Ailing Sun\n6. The Extent Of It\n\nThank you for downloading our first EP.  We hope you enjoy listening to it, as much as we love playing it for you. We released this EP in June 2009 and quickly sold out of physical copies of the CD.  We are greatly appreciative to everyone who bought one but we understand that some people may have missed out which is why we are offering you this download. We would also like to encourage you to go forth to iTunes and purchase the EP if you do enjoy it because with your money we can continue to fund the band's cocain habits which is how they come up with such killer tunes.\n\nKeep an eye on the following sites for details about our upcoming shows, where we will sign burnt copies of our EP \n\nwww.reverbnation.com/shellfin\n\n\nSincerely,\nShellfin\n\nwww.soultraderentertainment.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d97086c9f011756be14f283a331467c107311d97","amp;dn":"Shellfin+-+Stay+For+Tea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d97086c9f011756be14f283a331467c107311d97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,112,134,201,240,17,117,107,225,79,40,58,51,20,103,193,7,49,29,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
