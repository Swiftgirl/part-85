Full Descriptionemo-tweens, CRASH LOVE is less mannered than its predecessor and reveals a band exploding with a creative power pop and metal spark. Though lead singer Davey Havok's glitter-goth persona is well intact, it seems tempered here with a bit more punkish muscle and '80s pop croon. These songs have madly obsessive hooks along with a sparkling production that never sacrifices the hard rock energy at the core of each song. In that sense, such tracks as &quot;Too Shy to Scream,&quot; with its tribal drumbeat homage to Adam Ant's &quot;Goody Two Shoes,&quot; and the swooning romantic anthem &quot;Veronica Sawyer Smokes&quot; come as double ice cream scoops of sugary rock bliss. Think equal parts solo Morrissey and the Raspberries. Similarly moving is the pyrrhic mid-album rock ballad &quot;Okay, I Feel Better Now,&quot; with Havok's cries of &quot;I died for the last lie/And the heartbreak for the first time/I could not take 'til I made you cry.&quot; However, AFI are anything but saccharine, and tracks like the epic fist-pumping leadoff single, &quot;Medicate,&quot; with its slabs of distorted Jimmy Page-esque lead guitar lines, and the equally blood pressure-raising &quot;I Am Trying Very Hard to Be Here&quot; are both kick-butt rockers and dancefloor-ready rave-ups. Ultimately, AFI have lightened up the band's darkly sexy vibe on CRASH LOVE and delivered a yearning, perfect pop/rock crush of an album. \n\nGoth-punk firebrands AFI follow up their smash 2006 effort, Decemberunderground, with the propulsive blast of alt-glam that is 2009's Crash Love.
