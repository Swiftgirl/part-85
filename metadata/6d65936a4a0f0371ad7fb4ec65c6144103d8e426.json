It showed Tyler working out lyrics that were so much more than simple cars and girls fodder, 'Adam's Apple' theorizing that creation could quite possibly have occurred with an alien mothership landing on earth and setting the wheels of the human race in motion. 'Sweet Emotion' throbbed slowly into life, 'Big Ten Inch Record', a salty R&amp;B work-out, while 'You See Me Crying' was heightened and given body by a warm orchestration. A clear steeple of great work amid a skyline of repeating successes. \n\nRecorded at the Record Plant, New York, New York. \n\nPersonnel: Joe Perry (vocals, guitar, acoustic guitar, slide guitar, percussion, background vocals); Steven Tyler (vocals, harmonica, keyboards, percussion); Joey Kramer (vocals, drums, percussion); Tom Hamilton, Brad Whitford (guitar); Scott Cushnie (piano); Jay Messina (marimba, percussion). \n\nRecording information: Record Plant, NY; The Record Plant, NY. \n\n1.
