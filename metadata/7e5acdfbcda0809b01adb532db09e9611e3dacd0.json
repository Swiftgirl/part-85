Deep Purple, at the behest of keyboardman Jon Lord, fell briefly into\nthe camp of this offshoot of early progressive rock with the Concerto for Group and\nOrchestra. For most fans, the album represented the nadir of the classic (i.e., post-Rod\nEvans) group: minutes of orchestral meandering lead into some perfectly good hard rock\njamming by the band, but the trip is almost not worth the effort. Ritchie Blackmore sounds\ngreat and plays his heart out, and you can tell this band is going to go somewhere, just by\nvirtue of the energy that they put into these extended pieces. The classical influences mostly\nseem drawn from movie music composers Dimitri Tiomkin and Franz Waxman (and Elmer\nBernstein), with some nods to Rachmaninoff, Sibelius, and Mahler, and they rather just lay\nthere. Buried in the middle of the second movement is a perfectly good song, but you've got\nto get to it through eight minutes of orchestral noodling on either side. The third movement is\nalmost bracing enough to make up for the flaws of the other two, though by itself, it wouldn't\nmake the CD worthwhile -- Pink Floyd proved far more adept at mixing group and orchestra,\nand making long, slow, lugubrious pieces interesting. As a bonus, however, the producers\nhave added a pair of hard rock numbers by the group alone, &quot;Wring That Neck&quot; and &quot;Child in\nTime,&quot; that were played at the same concert. They and the third movement of the established\npiece make this worth a listen.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFrom Wiki\n\n\nThe Concerto for Group and Orchestra is a concerto composed by Jon Lord, with lyrics written \nby Ian Gillan. It was first performed by Deep Purple and The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra \nconducted by Malcolm Arnold on 24 September 1969 and released on vinyl in December 1969. The \nrelease was the first Deep Purple album to feature Ian Gillan on vocals and Roger Glover on \nbass. After the score was lost in 1970, it was performed again in 1999 with a recreated score.\n\n\n\n01. [12:51] - Wring That Neck [Bonus Track]\n02. [12:27] - Child In Time [Bonus Track]\n03.
