Hes also the most negative man alive. Floundering in all aspects of his life, Bens only comfort comes from regular chess games and friendly debates on game theory with his Senegalese roommate Ibou (Michael Kenneth Williams). When Ibou is suddenly struck ill, and an insensitive municipal employee exacerbates the emergency situation, Bens pessimistic worldview seems unequivocally confirmed. His only recourse is to pour his energies into a frivolous lawsuit against the city for depraved indifference. But Ben soon finds that cynicism may be all a matter of perspective. WONDERFUL WORLD is directed by Josh Goldin and also features Sanaa Lathan and Philip Baker Hall.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.traileraddict.com/trailer/wonderful-world/trailer-b&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.traileraddict.com/trailer/wonderful-world/trailer-b&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWonderful.World.2009.1080p.BluRay.ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€264-CiNEFiLE\n\nRelease Date ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦: 03/18/10\nVideo ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.. x264 @ 11289 kbps\nAudio ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦..
