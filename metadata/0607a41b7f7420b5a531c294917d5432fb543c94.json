The show's central character is Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), an unconventional, maverick medical genius who heads a team of diagnosticians at the fictional Princeton Plainsboro Teaching Hospital (PPTH) in New Jersey. The character has similarities to Sherlock Holmes: both are forensic geniuses, musicians, drug users, aloof, and largely friendless.\n\nSeason 3 - 24 episodes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0607a41b7f7420b5a531c294917d5432fb543c94","amp;dn":"House%2C+MD+-+Season+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0607a41b7f7420b5a531c294917d5432fb543c94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,7,164,27,127,116,32,181,165,49,194,148,145,125,84,50,251,84,60,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
