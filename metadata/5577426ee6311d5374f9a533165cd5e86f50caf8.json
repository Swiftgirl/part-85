SyFy is planning to release a modified Pilot on 1/22/10, hopefully they wont bastardize it to much. When I read about it I decided to re-up the original so those of you BSG fans that havent gotten a chance to see it can grab it..\n\nHeres a little info..\n*****************************************\nSet 58 years before Battlestar Galactica, Caprica follows two rival families - the Graystones and the Adamas - as they grow, compete, and thrive in the vibrant world of the peaceful 12 Colonies, living in a society close to our own. Entangled in the burgeoning technology of artificial intelligence and robotics that will eventually lead to the creation of the Cylons, the two houses go toe-to-toe, blending action with corporate conspiracy and sexual politics. Caprica will deliver, intrigue, political backbiting and family conflict in television's first science fiction family saga.\n\nDaniel Graystone, a computer genius, is owner of a large computer corporation that is spearheading the development of artificial intelligence. He and his wife Amanda, who's a brilliant surgeon, are both relentless in their scientific pursuits. The Adama clan is helmed by Joseph Adama, a renowned criminal defense attorney and father of future Battlestar commander William Adama. When tragedy strikes both families, lines are drawn that will determine the fate of the human race.\n******************************************\n\nAnd some screenshots &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/jAJgGaaCd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/jAJgGaaCd&lt;/a&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/JAjGiAACd\nhttp://bayimg.com/JaJGKaAcD\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5577426ee6311d5374f9a533165cd5e86f50caf8","amp;dn":"caprica.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5577426ee6311d5374f9a533165cd5e86f50caf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,119,66,110,230,49,29,83,116,249,165,51,22,92,213,232,111,80,202,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
