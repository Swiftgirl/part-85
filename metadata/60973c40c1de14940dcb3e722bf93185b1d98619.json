The show's central character is Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), an unconventional, maverick medical genius who heads a team of diagnosticians at the fictional Princeton Plainsboro Teaching Hospital (PPTH) in New Jersey. The character has similarities to Sherlock Holmes: both are forensic geniuses, musicians, drug users, aloof, and largely friendless.\n\nSeason 5 - 24 episodes\n\nApologies: ***Missing episode 8***","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60973c40c1de14940dcb3e722bf93185b1d98619","amp;dn":"House%2C+MD+-+Season+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60973c40c1de14940dcb3e722bf93185b1d98619","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,151,60,64,193,222,20,148,13,203,62,114,43,249,49,133,177,217,134,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
