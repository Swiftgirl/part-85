It has stadiums for the leagues of over 43 different countries. If you play as a top English team in the Champions League, 98% of your matches will have background stadium, it is the anti-default background pack. \n\nI have found all the club images for the team screens, all the big European clubs have 1024 x 768 screens of great moments in their history-even Tottenham has some, this is all my own work, on the editing and creating of configs for the 'glory moments' backgrounds put in one background pack to make life easier for everyone.\n\nOnce downloaded, extract the folder using Winrar. Then put the 'backgrounds' folder into your Sports Interactive/data folder on your C drive. It works best with StekloX skin as you can see the ground with this skin.\n\n\n\nPeace,\n\n\n\nMoskollo\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04871bc5b8c019b32362ae6dc00516f706603929","amp;dn":"Moskollo+FM10+Background+Stadiums+Folder","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04871bc5b8c019b32362ae6dc00516f706603929","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,135,27,197,184,192,25,179,35,98,174,109,192,5,22,247,6,96,57,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
