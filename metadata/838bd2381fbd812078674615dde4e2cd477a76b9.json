As a developer, you will no longer be bogged down \n  learning complex installation programs or yet another awkward scripting language. \n  This guarantees hassle-free programming, quicker market delivery and ultimately a \n  faster turnaround with more satisfied users. Smart Install Maker enables the creation \n  of a professional-looking, custom-made setup file in just a few mouse clicks. The \n  simplicity of Smart Install Maker means:\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n  * Create smaller setup files with built-in ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Ëœab compression. Smaller size \n    distributives are quicker to download and give users a better installation experience.\n\n  * Control installation and uninstallation ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ decide the method, time and contents of \n    installation, modification or removal (including registry, .ini and config files).\n\n  * Check system requirements automatically. If the current system does not comply with \n    the minimum requirements, the installer can notify the user of the problem or \n    automatically abort installation.\n\n  * Customize the installation environment and appearance of wizard screens \n    (eg add gradients or images to the window background, add header image, logo image, etc).\n\n  * Customize screens for display during installation (eg license agreements, readme files, etc).\n\n  * Use the OS native language: automatically identify the language of the target \n    operating system and adjust the screen and message language settings accordingly.\n\n  * Execute custom commands, operate with installer variables, verify passwords, \n    customize uninstall, manage uninstall feedback.\n\n  * Ensure a clean uninstall with no leftovers or orphan files, folders, services or \n    registry records.\n\n  * Create silent installations that do not display installation dialogs and messages.\n\n  * Cut development time. Avoid learning new languages or complex software ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ get hold \n    of the intuitive GUI and enjoy the speedy setup creation process.\n\n\n======================================================================================\n         No Virus .
