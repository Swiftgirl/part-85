After making out with his ladyfriend, the guy reads a spell from the book. The spell has the effect of changing the woman into a demonic zombie. She tries to kille the man, but he manages to kill her instead. She rises out of the grave as a full-fledged zombie, and does him in. Later, a group of friends head out to the countryside where that cursed house happens to be. They plan to have some fun. The single woman follows a female spirit when she sees that old house. A crazy man/wizard shows up and tries to warn them. The young people decide to stay at the house, and soon they find the book and all hell breaks loose. A number of the characters either become demonically-possessed zombies or full zombies.\n\nRunning Time: 96 Minutes\n\n=====================================\n\nDVDRip\nAVI\nVideo: Xvid 640x320 25.00fps 755kbps [Video 0]\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 44100Hz stereo 128kbps [Audio 1]\n\nTeaser","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6394737cc4bbe917ce6c3e6269f3bf2124717c77","amp;dn":"Bach+Ke+Zaraa+%28RUS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6394737cc4bbe917ce6c3e6269f3bf2124717c77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,148,115,124,196,187,233,23,206,108,62,98,105,243,191,33,36,113,124,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
