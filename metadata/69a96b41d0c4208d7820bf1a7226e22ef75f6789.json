You won't find any bootlegs, though (not that IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m against bootlegs, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s that I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have any yet).\n\n- All the MP3 files have their ID3 tags updated and with all the information. This is regarding Artist, Album, Year, Song, Track Number, Genre and Composer. This was done automatically using Windows Media Player. However, I have checked every file in search for mistakes or missing information.\n- A 300 x 300 picture of the cover has been attached to every MP3 file so the listening is more ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œvisualÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. This way, when you play the file using Windows Media Player or your Ipod for example, you will see the cover immediately. This was done using 'Tag&amp;Rename 3.4' (not included).\n- Every folder has its ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“folder.jpgÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“AlbumArtSmall.jpgÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ hidden files so you can see the covers when browsing your ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“My MusicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ directory, or whichever the directory you use to store your MP3 files.\n- It doesn't include the covers on separate files, sorry. If you want them, you can always search for them on the internet.\n- The folders have been named using this format: 'yyyy, mm-dd - name of the album', where 'yyyy, mm-dd' is the date of release; this is to keep the exact order of release. I know that even though I found this helpful, you might not like it; sorry for the inconvenience.\n\nIn short, this was thought and designed so that you just copy the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Iron MaidenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ folder into your ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“My MusicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ directory, or whichever the directory you use to store your MP3 files, and start enjoying without having to worry about anything else.\n\nThis is what you get with this collection:\n\nSTUDIO ALBUMS:\n1980 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Iron Maiden\n1981 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Killers\n1982 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Number of the Beast\n1983 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Piece of Mind\n1984 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Powerslave\n1986 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Somewhere in Time\n1988 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\n1990 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ No Prayer for the Dying\n1992 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Fear of the Dark\n1995 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The X Factor\n1998 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Virtual XI\n2000 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Brave New World\n2003 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Dance of Death\n2006 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ A Matter of Life and Death\n\nLIVE ALBUMS:\n1985 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Live After Death\n1993 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ A Real Live One*\n1993 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ A Real Dead One*\n1993 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Live in Donington\n2002 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Rock in Rio\n2005 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Death on the Road\n2009 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Flight 666: The Original Soundtrack\n\n* These two albums later became 'A Real Live Dead One'.
