Because of this the mkv is sligthly\n       &quot;undersized&quot;.\n                \n    Why doesn't everything get released as BD5/BD9?\n           \n    -&gt; We don't know and there is no logical reason. However, as time goes on other\n       groups cannot continue to ignore the bluray community by stubbornly releasing\n       incompatible BluRay releases. It's like releasing DVDR's that don't run in\n       DVD Players.\n\n    Tested and working on these players:\n    \n       Denon DVD-3800BDCI\n       DVico TViX (mixed results on tvix 6500 as mkv, m2ts works)\n       DXVA (DirectX Video Acceleration)\n       Insignia N5-BRDVD\n       LG BH200 (pre 0602 firmware)\n       Magnavox NB500MG9\n       Microsoft XBOX360 (AAC 2.0 audio in mp4 container)\n       Panasonic DMP-BD30\n       Panasonic DMP-BD35\n       Panasonic DMP-BD50\n       Panasonic DMP-BD55\n       Popcorn Hour\n       Samsung BD-P1400\n       Samsung BD-P1500\n       Sony Playstation 3\n       Sony BDP-BX1\n       Sony BDP-S300\n       Sony BDP-S350\n       Sony BDP-S500\n       Sony BDP-S550\n          \n    Not working on:\n           \n       Sharp BD-HP20\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe2827d56bdf5b9dfc4de61707696d32f8cb06d4","amp;dn":"Trick+%5C%27r+Treat+1080p+%28MKV+%2B+BD5%29+English%2FAmerican+Spanish+5.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe2827d56bdf5b9dfc4de61707696d32f8cb06d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,40,39,213,107,223,91,157,252,77,230,23,7,105,109,50,248,203,6,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
