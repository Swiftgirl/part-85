But his luck doesn't turn until he finds a curiosity at a junk shop-sheet music for what is supposedly Jimi Hendrix's last song. Although the aging beatnik who runs the shop warns him that playing the music will summon up the devil, Mitch buys it anyway. When he plays it, he suddenly finds his fortunes improving, thanks in part to the efforts of a new manager, sleek Simon Rathbone. But-surprise, surprise-it isn't all roses from here on out. Cold Turkey Singer, songwriter, and recovering addict Jared is trying to get his act together before his band starts a new tour, but he's finding it hard to write new songs without chemical assistance. Enter an alluring blond, who leads him back to the bottle and into trouble even as she helps him find inspiration again. But who is she, really? (Don't read the cover blurb, or you'll find out way too soon.) Instant Karma Innocent Lara idolizes bad-boy rock star Vince Brava and is convinced that they are soul mates. When she's tapped to join other groupies on his tour bus after a concert, she's delighted at the chance to show Vince how much they have in common. After Vince takes advantage of her innocence, however, she's determined to get revenge;but when she and Vince swap bodies, her vengeance is far more appropriate even than she had planned. Don't Stop Believin' Senatorial candidate Ben Stanton is on the brink of losing the election, to the disgust of his ambitious wife. Ever since he was involved in a car accident in which his young mistress was killed, he's been trailing in the polls. But listening to the CD she made him of his campaign song suddenly takes him back to the moments before the accident. Maybe this time he can change the course of events.\n\nRoger Daltrey, Jason Gedrick, Wendie Malick, James Marsters, Lindsay Sloane, Peter Strauss, Jennifer Anne Lee","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2a33ad48cc65c92f8252282d317d2e31df3f5de","amp;dn":"Vh1+Strange+Freency+1+%26+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2a33ad48cc65c92f8252282d317d2e31df3f5de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,163,58,212,140,198,92,146,248,37,34,130,211,23,210,227,29,243,245,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
