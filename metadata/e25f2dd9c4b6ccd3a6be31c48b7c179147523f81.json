Bianca begs her sister    \n         to have a night of &quot;teenage normalcy&quot; Little     \n         does Bianca know that not only Joey is trying    \n         to set her sister up but also Cameron her        \n         cute, but also unpopular French tutor. Joey      \n         and Camereon's &quot;set up guy&quot; Patrick is trying    \n         to get Kat to go out with him. But does it       \n         work, will Kat go out with him?
