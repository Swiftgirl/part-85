However, many publishers are also lazy, so they end up using same protection for every game. Of course, even most advanced defensive mechanisms could be cracked soon or lately, which would render defenseless every product protected by it. Such thing already happened to Reflexive Arcade's one: after crunching it (for fun) 2 days ago, I have come to the decision of automatizing this uneasy, yet fairly entertaining (for the first few times) process: we have already seen auto-unpackers and universal keygenerators, so now it's a time for some user-friendly patcher...
