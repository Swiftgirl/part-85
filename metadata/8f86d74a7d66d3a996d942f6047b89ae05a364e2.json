The original lyrics of the song Stille Nacht were written in German by the Austrian priest Father Josef Mohr and the melody was composed by the Austrian headmaster Franz Xaver Gruber. In 1859, John Freeman Young published the English translation that is most frequently sung today. The version of the melody that is generally sung today differs slightly (particularly in the final strain) from Gruber's original. Today, the lyrics and melody are in the public domain.\n\nChristmas Through Your Eyes is the fourth studio solo album released by Latin-American singer Gloria Estefan, and sixteenth overall, in 1993.\n\nGloria Estefan (born Gloria MarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­a Fajardo GarcÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­a; September 1, 1957) is a Grammy Award-winning Cuban-American singer and songwriter.
