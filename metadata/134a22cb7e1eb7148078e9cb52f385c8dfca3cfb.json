Much of the film is told through flashbacks spanning George's entire life and narrated by Franklin and Joseph, unseen Angels who are preparing Clarence for his mission to save George. Through these flashbacks we see all the people whose lives have been touched by George and the difference he has made to the community in which he lives.\n\nThe film is regarded as a classic and is a staple of Christmas television around the world, although, due to its high production costs and stiff competition at the box office, financially, it was considered a &quot;flop.&quot; The film's break-even point was actually $6.3 million, approximately twice the production cost, a figure it never came close to achieving in its initial release.[2] An appraisal in 2006 reported: &quot;Although it was not the complete box-office failure that today everyone believes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ it was a major disappointment and confirmed, at least to the studios, that Capra was no longer capable of turning out the populist features that made his films the must-see, money-making events they once were.&quot;[3]\n\nIt's a Wonderful Life was nominated for five Oscars without winning any, but the film has since been recognized by the American Film Institute as one of the 100 best American films ever made, and placed number one on their list of the most inspirational American films of all time.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:134a22cb7e1eb7148078e9cb52f385c8dfca3cfb","amp;dn":"It%5C%27s+a+wonderful+life+1946+colorized+mobile+video+%2Beng+sub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"134a22cb7e1eb7148078e9cb52f385c8dfca3cfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,74,34,203,126,30,183,20,128,120,233,203,82,243,133,200,223,202,60,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
