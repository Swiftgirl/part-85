This is what I use.\nVLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.\nOne can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.\nQuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.\nPS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.\nAnd please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).Many of movies I encode have embedded subtitles. So far, only VLC player is able to use them correctly.\n\nNOTE: Yesterday's version had some &quot;issues&quot; in last two minutes.\nI cut-out last three minutes of credits and heighten a bitrate 3.6%.\nThat's why I have decided to release this PROPER.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa41469501311623fe29a5e0d3a7fd47fdb990dc","amp;dn":"The.Road.DVDSCR.PROPER.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa41469501311623fe29a5e0d3a7fd47fdb990dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,65,70,149,1,49,22,35,254,41,165,224,211,167,253,71,253,185,144,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
