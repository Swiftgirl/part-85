However, it is intended to run on Windows XP/Vista/7 x86/x64 platforms. If the executable does not run as it should, it could be due to missing runtime libraries or dependency files. Please report those to me in this thread and i'd get them included.\n\nDevelopment Notes\nAlthough the saved profiles made using this program is identical to those used by EAM/PSE/ECE, no data from the above mentioned applications were hijacked in the development of this trainer. This trainer uses my own set of uniquely formated data that is embedded during compilation. Acts of hijacking are considered unethical by Code.Slice. All images, addresses and data acquired are from efforts of my own.\n\nDisclaimer\nCode.Slice will not be responsible for any undesirable consequences should any arise through the use of this unlocker. Use any editors/cheats at your own risk. No cheats are foolproof, at least not forever.\n\nDownloads\nThe executable is compressed and uploaded as a WinZip archive. You'll require appropriate extractors such as WinZip, WinRar and 7Zip to extract the files properly.\n\n[If this one fails, try this one: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5407872]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa5ecb6261fedf8205b374613b25c1c2c74c6bdc","amp;dn":"Call.of.Duty.Modern.Warfare.2.Mega.Unlocker%28LegitHackingTool%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa5ecb6261fedf8205b374613b25c1c2c74c6bdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,94,203,98,97,254,223,130,5,179,116,97,59,37,193,194,199,76,107,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
