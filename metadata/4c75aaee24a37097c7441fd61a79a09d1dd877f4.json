Though nearly 30 years ago, attitudes have not changed as much as one might expect. When The Sensei screened in early December on World AIDS Day at the Anchorage International Film Festival, Inosanto received an enthusiastic standing ovation even as one guy told her his black belt would be stripped away if he took in a gay student. Since then she has received support from gay martial artists who remain closeted or others who feel they cannot openly take a stance.\n\n\n\nDiana Lee Inosanto (born May 29, 1973) is a Filipino American actress, stuntwoman, martial artist and film director. Inosanto grew up in Torrance, California, and is the daughter of Dan Inosanto and Sue Ann Reveal, and godchild of Bruce Lee, after whom she was named. As a single mother she raised a son with autism. In 1995 she married Ron Balicki, one of her father's former students, and with whom she has two sons.\n\n\nInosanto grew up surrounded by the martial arts world, studying many forms including Jeet Kune Do which she learned from her father, Dan Inosanto, who was a student of Jeet Kune Do founder Bruce Lee.
