He thought he would just sit down, have a slow beer or two, and talk to a stranger. He couldn't know that it would lead to a narrow escape from a bungalow targeted by a SWAT team. Or that it would leave him a wanted man.\n\nNow he is on the run from mysterious and ruthless men. He is in love with a woman he knows next to nothing about. And he is hiding from a past he can't fully remember. On his trail is a shadowy security agency that answers to no one, including the U.S. government, and a man who considers himself a compassionate Angel of Death. But worst of all, Spencer Grant is on a collision course with inner demons he thought he'd buried years ago - inner demons that could destroy him if his enemies don't first.\n\nunabridged 19hs 24 min.\n\nAlso look up &quot;The Pillars of the Earth&quot; This is another great audio book both in story and length. Great for the long haul!\n\nazoozz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83ba95f78c4bc86fb4d8489f227f01dcb7c8132b","amp;dn":"Dark+Rivers+of+the+Heart+Dean+Koontz+%5Bazoozz%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83ba95f78c4bc86fb4d8489f227f01dcb7c8132b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,186,149,247,140,75,200,111,180,216,72,159,34,127,1,220,183,200,19,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
