But can they rescue Papadoll and defeat Buburina before the sun rises?&quot;\n\nBilingual: English and Japanese\nEnglish Subtitles\n\n75 Minutes\n\n(I realized there was something wrong with the audio on the old upload, but this one is fixed!)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b35a5de560e457eac3babf75b0a9482ad7b4f60","amp;dn":"Catnapped.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b35a5de560e457eac3babf75b0a9482ad7b4f60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,53,165,222,86,14,69,126,172,59,171,247,91,10,148,130,173,123,79,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
