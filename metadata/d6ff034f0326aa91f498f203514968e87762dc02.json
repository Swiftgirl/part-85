This package runs great under Windows 2000, XP or 7, 32 bit versions.\n\nCurrently, under Windows some original files are still needed for the game to run properly. These original files are included. The OpenTTD files are version 0.7.4. Check http://www.openttd.org for possible updates, or a direct download of all but the original files.\nIf you download the package from there, all you need to download in this package is the &quot;original files.zip&quot; file, and the &quot;How to install.txt&quot;.\n\nHave fun!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6ff034f0326aa91f498f203514968e87762dc02","amp;dn":"OpenTTD+for+Windows+-+32+bit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6ff034f0326aa91f498f203514968e87762dc02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,255,3,79,3,38,170,145,244,152,242,3,81,73,104,232,119,98,220,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
