Unlike other music games, which penalize players if they don't play perfectly, Wii Music is a musical playground where there are no mistakes. Here anyone can pick up and master the huge array of instruments available, through simple motions like strumming and drumming. Musicians in your band jam by simply playing their instruments to the beat of a song or by improvising to their heart's content. Play faster. Play slower. Skip a beat, or throw in 10 more. No matter what you do, Wii Music automatically transforms your improv stylings into great music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce54940667e0e0bbf374840f0f736e942b08ee92","amp;dn":"Wii+Music+%5BPAL%5D+%5BWiiTorrentZ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce54940667e0e0bbf374840f0f736e942b08ee92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,84,148,6,103,224,224,187,243,116,132,15,15,115,110,148,43,8,238,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
