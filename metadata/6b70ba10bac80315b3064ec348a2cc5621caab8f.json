Armed with a loaded revolver, a bottle of Scotch whisky and a running tape recorder, while surrounded by closed circuit television cameras, he spends the next 90 minutes recalling, with rage, suspicion, sadness and disappointment, his controversial life and career in a monologue.\n\nAfter resigning in disgrace, Richard Nixon (Philip Baker Hall) sits at a desk in his study late at night, dictating his memoirs. Taking one drink, then another, he rants about Eisenhower, Castro, Khruschchev, Kissinger, the Kennedys, and any number of other people, some real, some imagined, finally cohering into a remarkable explanation of why his fall from grace was actually a supreme and selfless act of patriotism. Robert Altman's film adaptation of Hall's one-man show (written by Donald Freed and Arnold Stone) makes this performance feel more cinematic than one might expect, as the visual rhythms subtly match the ebbs and flows of Hall's performance. While Hall doesn't look or sound much like Nixon, the sheer, paranoid force of his characterization is thoroughly convincing: love Nixon or hate him, Secret Honor will give you plenty of support either way.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088074/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088074/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDVDRip\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1.966 kbps\nResolution: 720x544\nFull screen (4x3)\nAspect Ratio:1.324\nFrame Rate: 23.976 FPS\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kbps CBR 48 KHz\nSize: 1368 GB\n\nAudio: English\nSubtitles: English, Portuguese\n\nRobert Altman - Secret Honor (1984)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b70ba10bac80315b3064ec348a2cc5621caab8f","amp;dn":"Robert+Altman+-+Secret+Honor+%281984%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b70ba10bac80315b3064ec348a2cc5621caab8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,112,186,16,186,200,3,21,179,6,78,195,72,162,204,86,33,202,171,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
