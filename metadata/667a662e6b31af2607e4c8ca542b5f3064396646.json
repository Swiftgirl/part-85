Baby One More Time,&quot; and its subject matter ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which appears to be about loving multiple people at one time ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ is sure to cause a stir. Of course, Spears has been causing that kind of stir since she dressed in a sexy school-girl uniform for the &quot;... Baby One More Time&quot; video.\n\nThe song, which is posted on New York radio station Z-100's Web site, is a catchy dance track with provocative lyrics, such as, &quot;1, 2, 3/ Not only you and me/ Got 180 degrees/ And I'm caught in between.&quot; The chorus also mentions &quot;Peter, Paul and Mary,&quot; which would seem to be an out-of-left-field reference to the '60s folk act. \n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/210/shot0001uy.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/210/shot0001uy.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img714.imageshack.us/img714/3520/shot0002.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img714.imageshack.us/img714/3520/shot0002.png&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:667a662e6b31af2607e4c8ca542b5f3064396646","amp;dn":"Britney+Spears+-+3+2009+x264+MTVHD+720p.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"667a662e6b31af2607e4c8ca542b5f3064396646","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,122,102,46,107,49,175,38,7,228,200,202,84,43,95,48,100,57,102,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
