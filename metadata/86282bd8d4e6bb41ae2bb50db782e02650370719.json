Gein was only positively linked to two murders and suspected of two others. He gathered most of his materials not through murder, but grave-robbing. In the popular imagination, however, he remains a serial killer with uncounted victims.. if you like the movie PLEASE SEED it so others can enjoy it to.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86282bd8d4e6bb41ae2bb50db782e02650370719","amp;dn":"The+Silence+of+the+Lambs+%281991%29+1080p.AC3%28Dolby%29.5.1ch.Blu-ray.P","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86282bd8d4e6bb41ae2bb50db782e02650370719","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,40,43,216,212,230,187,65,174,43,181,13,183,130,224,38,80,55,7,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
