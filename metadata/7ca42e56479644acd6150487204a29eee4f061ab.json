Out of desperation, they try to make their way toward the coast for possible food and shelter, or to find other &quot;good&quot; survivors. Knowing the state to which humanity has fallen, the man carries a pistol with two bullets in case they need to hasten the end. Along the way, they find scarce shelter and resources available to them, and have to avoid bands of cannibals while trying to maintain their own sense of morality and humanity. Various flashback sequences occur in which the man recalls events prior to the catastrophe, many involving his believed-to-be-deceased wife, who has a much more expanded role in the film than in the book. It is revealed that his wife, depressed after delivering a child into a seemingly doomed world and having lost the will to go on, has left the family in the middle of the night without any supplies and into certain death. Meanwhile, the man coughs up blood and realizes he's likely to die soon, but tries to instill values of self-preservation and humanity on his young son.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0898367/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0898367/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPLEASE SEED AND ENJOY THANKS\n\nscreen shots\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img687.imageshack.us/img687/1004/theroadxvidviceavithumb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img687.imageshack.us/img687/1004/theroadxvidviceavithumb.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ca42e56479644acd6150487204a29eee4f061ab","amp;dn":"The+Road+2009%7BDvDRip.XviD%7Dvice","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ca42e56479644acd6150487204a29eee4f061ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,164,46,86,71,150,68,172,214,21,4,135,32,74,41,238,228,240,97,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
