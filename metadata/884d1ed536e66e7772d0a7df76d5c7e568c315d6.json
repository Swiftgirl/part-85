For the Bull,               \n      reality is brutal. His wife of 30               \n      years, sick of his infidelity, decides          \n      to show him the door. But the Bull,             \n      who has a positive outlook on life,             \n      isn't so easily defeated and fights             \n      for his survival. The Lion too faces a          \n      break-up when his girlfriend leaves.            \n     All alone, he's force to relearn the            \n    art of seduction.                              \n                                         \n                 \n             \n                \n         RIPPERS NOTES       \n                \n               \n                \n                                       \n                                           \n                                                 \n                                                   \n                                                \n                                           \n                                       \n                   \n               \n                  \n        NEWS         \n                  \n                 \n                 \n                                         \n            XViD ripper with own             \n                  supply                        \n                                               \n                                         \n                     \n                     \n                      \n            GREETINGS           \n                 \n                     \n                   \n                                         \n                                            \n                           VH-PROD             \n                   DoNE ,                   \n                   VoMiT, FRAGMENT             \n                      \n                            \n                                \n               CONNTACT              \n                        \n                          \n                         \n                                               \n            Mail:&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;375152525b5e5943405e44435253775f42445f5a565e5b1954585a&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;         \n            Http: Never                          \n           Irc : Private","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:884d1ed536e66e7772d0a7df76d5c7e568c315d6","amp;dn":"Cruising.Bar.II.2008.DVDRip.XViD-TWiST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"884d1ed536e66e7772d0a7df76d5c7e568c315d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,77,30,213,54,230,110,119,114,208,167,223,118,213,199,229,104,195,21,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
