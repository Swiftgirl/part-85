DID you know you can step outside the system if you know the rules of the illusion you were born into!!?? Please listen to this\n\nsome of the opening quotes are..\n\nA truthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s initial commotion is directly proportional to how deeply the lie was believed. It wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t the world being round that agitated people but that the world wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t flat. When a well-packaged web of lies has\nbeen sold gradually to the masses over generations, the truth will seem utterly preposterous and its speaker a raving lunatic. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Dresden James\n\nEach progressive spirit is opposed by a thousand mediocre minds appointed to guard the past. ~ Maurice Maeterlinck\n\nContempt, prior to complete investigation, enslaves men to ignorance. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Dr. John Whitman Ray\n\nIn a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ George Orwell\n\nIf you want to make someone angry, tell him a lie; if you want to make him furious, tell him the truth.\n\nAll truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed, second it is violently opposed, and third, it is\naccepted as self-evident. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Arthur Schopenhauer Philosopher, 1788-1860\n\nAs scarce as truth is, the supply has always been in excess of the demand. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ J Billings\nDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t confuse your opinion with the truth. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Werner Erhard\n\nIts a rare person who wants to hear what he doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want to hear. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Dick Cavett\n\nThe power to fit in with oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s social peers can be irresistible. To a human lemming, the logic behind an opinion doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t count as much as the power and popularity behind an opinion. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Norman Livergood?\n\nIf the truth is that ugly -- which it is -- then we do have to be careful about the way that we tell the truth.\nBut to say somehow that telling the truth should be avoided because people may respond badly to the truth\nseems bizarre to me. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Chuck Skoro, Deacon, St. Paul's Catholic church\n\nNeo: What truth? Morpheus: That you are a slave, Neo. That you, like everyone else, was born into\nbondage... kept inside a prison that you cannot smell, taste, or touch ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a prison for your mind.
