The film contains some very dark and disturbing subject matter. The story occurs in a nightmarishly apocalyptic city, and follows the adventures of an undead hero (a memorable performance by Brandon Lee) on an often violent mission of revenge.\n\nGraeme meets the challenge of this cinematic vision brilliantly. The music for the film blends the feeling of classic film scoring with a contemporary pop/rock vibe. The tone of the music is dark, but contains moments of hopeful beauty.\n\nOne of the really noteworthy aspects of this score is the exotic flavor that permeates it. Revell achieves this partly through the innovative use of ethnic instruments: the liner notes list the Armenian dudek and the shakuhachi among the instruments used. Frenzied percussive effects and bells also add to the overall feel of the music. Revell's score also makes effective use of choral voices to attain a haunting, mystical effect.\n\nA dark, romantic, and beautiful achievement.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01  Birth Of The Legend  \t6:17  \t\n02  Resurrection \t        2:10 \t\n03  The Crow Descends \t        2:32 \t\n04  Remembrance \t        2:56 \t\n05  Rain Forever \t        2:33 \t\n06  &quot;Her Eyes...So Innocent&quot; \t2:46 \t\n07  Tracking The Prey \t        3:36 \t\n08  Pain And Retribution \t2:34 \t\n09  Believe In Angels \t        3:32 \t\n10  Captive Child \t        2:34 \t\n11  Devil's Night \t        2:31 \t\n12  On Hallowed Ground \t        2:43 \t\n13  Inferno \t                5:03 \t\n14  Return To The Grave \t3:46 \t\n15  Last Rites \t                3:56\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33343bd1109c1aadcd656c24bddf7a66680ec85e","amp;dn":"Graeme+Revell+-+The+Crow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33343bd1109c1aadcd656c24bddf7a66680ec85e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,52,59,209,16,156,26,173,205,101,108,36,189,223,122,102,104,14,200,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
