Best of  all, leave  your printer     \n                  settings alone. To mail your letter, just     \n                  stick  an envelope  where the  paper goes     \n                  and let Easy Mail  Plus handle  the rest.     \n                  You  can  put  a sheet  of labels  in the     \n                  printer,   print   the   ones  you   need     \n                  immediately,  and  use  the  rest  of the     \n                  label   sheet   another  time.

Use  our predefined  envelopes and     \n                  labels  (metric  and  U.S.)  or configure     \n                  your own. Use  one of  our logos,  or any     \n                  BMP, GIF, JPEG, WMF,  or ICO  image. Drag     \n                  and drop addresses, logos, and bar codes.     \n                  Put  post office  bar codes  on envelopes     \n                  and labels. Print to the entire list, one     \n                  at  a  time,  or  to  selected addresses.     \n                  Print just one label or a few  per sheet.     \n                  Print  a  full  sheet of  the same  or of     \n                  different addresses.                          \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                        \n                                                       \n                                          \n                                   \n                              \n                                                  \n               i N S T A L L   N O T E S            \n                                                    \n                                                           \n                                                                \n                                                             \n                                                                 \n                                                              \n                                                                 \n                                                                     \n                  1) Unpack                                     \n                  2) Install                                    \n                  3) Use details from serial.txt                \n                  4) Enjoy!                                     \n                  5) Fuck P2P                                   \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                        \n                                                       \n                                          \n                                   \n                              \n                                                  \n               N E W S  &amp;  C O N T A C T            \n                                                    \n                                                           \n                                                                \n                                                             \n                                                                 \n                                                              \n                                                                 \n                                                                     \n                  After so many years in the scene, both as     \n                  individuals   and   as   a  group   we've     \n                  definately  become  more  refined,   with     \n                  keygens  and retail  supplies and  not to     \n                  mention the  latest addition,  ebooks.
