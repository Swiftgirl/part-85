Its 2.5 hour+ running time moves at a great clip, and there's enough science and pseudoscience running around to give the film a certain of-the-moment wonder and clarity. The many destruction sequences throughout the film are absolutely breathtaking to behold, and one wonders if Roland Emmerich starts every film imagining how he will destroy the White House. Like all of his other films (except for The Patriot) it has big names but no huge names and really is a blast to watch. It has just the right balance of action and melodrama, often, as with all good films of this genre, in the same scene. The audience I watched it with was laughing and cheering throughout, and I'm sure it will be the definitive event movie of the holiday season, critics be damned. \n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nSubtitle : See at the start of the movie.(All the names mentioned)\n\nRuntime : 2:31:23\n\nCompatible with all standalone Divx Player (If any problem PM me)\n\nFile Size : 678 MB\n\nVideo: XVID 640x272 25.00fps 496Kbps\n\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 48000Hz stereo 117Kbps\n\n-----------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c79342488410ed22bb6807e7821255096171d655","amp;dn":"2012+%282009%29+DVDRip+XviD-uploadTILLuDIE+Eng+SUBS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c79342488410ed22bb6807e7821255096171d655","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,147,66,72,132,16,237,34,187,104,7,231,130,18,85,9,97,113,214,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
