Her first novel was about unrest\nin the UK during WWI. News of this was suppressed during\nthe war. It had been largely forgotten until her book was\npublished in 1936.\n\n'The Holiday' was published in 1949. It's set in the immediate\npost WWII period. Summer is turning to autumn. A group of people,\nsome made poor by the war, are revisiting their pre-war lives\ntrying and failing to pick up their relationships where they'd\nleft off at outbreak of war. The underlying theme seems to be\nthat we'll just have to learn to get along without Empire.\n\nIt's a well made dramatisation that throws light on the period.\n\nCast\nLucy Whybrow\nAndrew Wincott\nJanet Henfry\nGordon Reid\nRoger May\nPhilip Joseph\nRachel Preece\n\nNot Waving But Drowning\n\nNobody heard him, the dead man,\nBut still he lay moaning:\nI was much further out than you thought\nAnd not waving but drowning.\n\nPoor chap, he always loved larking\nAnd now he's dead\nIt must have been too cold for him his heart gave way,\nThey said.\n\nOh, no no no, it was too cold always\n(Still the dead one lay moaning)\nI was much too far out all my life\nAnd not waving but drowning.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/singlePoem.do?poemId=7089&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/singlePoem.do?poemId=7089&lt;/a&gt;\n.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a593631be7c43a97d5737a7f0d5e843a8302231","amp;dn":"BBC+R4+-+Stevie+Smith%5C%27s+%5C%27The+Holiday%5C%27+sp7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a593631be7c43a97d5737a7f0d5e843a8302231","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,89,54,49,190,124,67,169,125,87,55,167,240,213,232,67,168,48,34,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
