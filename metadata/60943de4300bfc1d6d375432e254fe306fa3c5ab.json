ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ this week he gave us some hope that all is not lost. Keep it up, John!\n\nBut also plenty of vitriol.\n\nG. E. Diaz:\nI was dismayed at John StosselÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s response to Jack ThompsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ If pregnancies have lowered, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s because day after pills are available, not because girls are having less sexÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Stossel was shallow and Mr. Loder rude and they both showed their low-brow values.\n\nAnna:\nStossel is a tool!\n\nDoodahman:\n\nHuh? Income for all but the top 5% has stagnated in real terms now for thirty years. The only respite was briefly during Clinton's administration. The entire decade saw NO JOB GROWTH AT ALL-- the first such decade since the DepressionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nStossel is just a shill for the ownership class who tries to confuse and demoralize workers-- it can't be the system that sucks, says Stossel. If you aren't getting ahead, it must be YOU.\n\nBut here are the facts:\n\nGDPpoor getting richer\n\nDood writes:\nStossel is right.. If you aren't getting ahead it is your fault. [I wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t go that far: some people do have bad luck] The recently released US Income Mobility Study showed economic growth resulted in rising incomes for most taxpayers over the period from 1996 to 2005. Median incomes of all taxpayers increased by 24 percent after adjusting for inflation. The real incomes of two-thirds of all taxpayers increased over this period. In addition, the median incomes of those initially in the lower income groups increased more than the median incomes of those initially in the higher income groups.\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d be interested to hear your comments, too.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60943de4300bfc1d6d375432e254fe306fa3c5ab","amp;dn":"20100204-Stossel-%5BThings+are+Better%5D.Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60943de4300bfc1d6d375432e254fe306fa3c5ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,148,61,228,48,11,252,29,109,55,84,50,226,84,254,48,111,163,197,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
