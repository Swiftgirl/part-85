The description of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwalls falling downÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is among its most well-known accounts. Yet, the most famous excavation of this ancient site, carried out in the 1950's under the direction of Kathleen Kenyon, claims that there wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t even a city at JerichoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½much less city wallsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½at the time when Joshua supposedly conquered it.\n\nFor more than fifty years scholars have built a wall of doubt against the historical accuracy of the Bible using Jericho as one of its cornerstones. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s time to face those challenges head on! ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s time to determine whether or not the conclusions of modern scholarship stand in light of the evidence or if those arguments donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t in fact collapse like JerichoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s walls.\n\nJoin us, as we return to the site of one of historyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most important battles in order to explore the crucial question relating to JoshuaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s conquest: Did the walls of Jericho really come tumbling down? Find out here in this episode of Expedition Bible.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBe strong and courageous, because you will lead these people to inherit the land I swore to their forefathers to give themÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (Joshua 1:6).\n\nto view online or to order the DVD: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.expeditionbible.com/jerichounearthed.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.expeditionbible.com/jerichounearthed.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMember Share.\n\n  ____                      _                      _   _       _\n / ___|___  _ __  ___ _ __ (_)_ __ __ _  ___ _   _| | | |_   _| |__\n| |   / _ \\| '_ \\/ __| '_ \\| | '__/ _` |/ __| | | | |_| | | | | '_ \\\n| |__| (_) | | | \\__ \\ |_) | | | | (_| | (__| |_| |  _  | |_| | |_) |\n \\____\\___/|_| |_|___/ .__/|_|_|  \\__,_|\\___|\\__, |_| |_|\\__,_|_.__/\n                     |_|                     |___/\n   ____\n  / ___|___  _ __ ___\n | |   / _ \\| '_ ` _ \\\n | |__| (_) | | | | | |\n(_)____\\___/|_| |_| |_|\n\n\nPLEASE KEEP SEEDED TO PASS ON MESSAGE.
