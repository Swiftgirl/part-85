Phillip, a young gay man, falls in love and begins to \nfeel the need to tell his parents about his true sexual self. The twist is that Philip's father is also \ngay/bisexual but keeps his yearning closeted from his wife and family. The parallel stories of these \ntwo men and the emotionally distraught wife and mother caught in-between results in an undeniably \npainful melodrama that is exceptionally sensitive to the issues of homosexuality, bisexuality, coming \nout and familial miscommunication \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e3eb8174790cc5dfb8248baab283e72eacf455b","amp;dn":"The.Lost.Language.of.Cranes.DvDrip.%281991%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e3eb8174790cc5dfb8248baab283e72eacf455b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,62,184,23,71,144,204,93,251,130,72,186,171,40,62,114,234,207,69,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
