Even though it is not as complete as their debut cd, this cd still is a goldmine for headbangers. Pontus Norgren promised, when the band split, to reform this group later (but it hasn't happend yet). And after listening to this group you will understand why he uttered those words. Great King Rat has a unique sound and all the individuals melt together in synergy to produce something outstanding!\n\n1.  Be my friend\n2.  Don't stop believing\n3.  Lay down our guns\n4.  Leavin this world\n5.  Long time\n6.  Loving You\n7.  Make it last\n8.  Restless one\n9.  Wide awake in dreamland\n10. Wont look back\n\nMelodic/Hard Rock from Sweden\n\nOriginal 1999\n\nCredits:\n\nLeif Sundin (vocals), Anders Nilsson (guitar), Pontus Norgren (guitar), Mikael HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶glund (bass), Tomas Broman (drums)\n\nI will upload this later in a higher quality (once I find my master copy of this cd).\n\nEnjoy!\n\nPs. If someone has Great King Rats debut album then please upload it. I need it so badly.......I love this group.
