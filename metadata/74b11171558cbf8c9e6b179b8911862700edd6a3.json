The first four issues focus on Marty and his way out of the closet and towards his first love, while later issues develop the other characters.\n\nCircles is published by Rabbit Valley and is available through their website. There are currently eight issues of the comic as of November 2008. Issue #1 is not readily available, except as part of Vol. 1, which collects issues #0 through #4 (pictured). \n\nThe setting is Boston, in the early years of the 21st century. The first issue is dated Spring 2001, and each issue corresponds to one season of time, with 4 issues being one year in the comic, so the latest issue as of this writing, issue #8, is Winter 2002. The comic deals primarily with six characters inhabiting a house at the fictional address of 6 Kinsey Circle (a pun on the Kinsey scale, where a rating of six means that the subject is exclusively homosexual). \n\nThis torrent contains:\n\nCircles issue 0-8\n\n\nRegards,\nSubwuffy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74b11171558cbf8c9e6b179b8911862700edd6a3","amp;dn":"Circles+issues+1-8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74b11171558cbf8c9e6b179b8911862700edd6a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,177,17,113,85,140,191,140,158,107,23,155,137,17,134,39,0,237,214,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
