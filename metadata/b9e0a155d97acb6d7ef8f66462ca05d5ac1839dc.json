Colonel Forbin doesn't meet\nIcculus this time but rather finds &quot;Ken Uncle Sam Bozo Easy Kesey&quot;.\nAt this time Kesey, dressed as Uncle Sam, appears on the stage and\naccounces that the Bozos have been missing for two years but are\non Phish tour now. He calls one by one the Tin Man, the Scarecrow,\nand Frankenstein (Phish breaks into &quot;Frankenstein&quot;) to help him\nfind the Bozos, which soon appear as four white things in costume.\nAfter singing about the Bozos which are doing interpretive dance,\nthe Pranksters all leave the stage after Kesey hears the &quot;Bozo\nMockingbird&quot;. Trey comments that this is what happens &quot;after you\ndo too much acid 30 years later...&quot; Phish had been playing\nbackground music (including McGrupp and Ghost teases) which had\ndeveloped by this point into a deep funk jam. Trey announces that\n&quot;we are supposed to start 'Famous Mockingbird', but the funk is\ntoo deep.&quot; The band continues the funk jam and eventually segues\ninto &quot;Camel Walk.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9e0a155d97acb6d7ef8f66462ca05d5ac1839dc","amp;dn":"1997-08-14","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9e0a155d97acb6d7ef8f66462ca05d5ac1839dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,224,161,85,217,122,203,109,126,248,246,100,98,202,5,213,172,24,57,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
