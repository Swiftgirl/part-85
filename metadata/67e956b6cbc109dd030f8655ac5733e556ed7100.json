A fitting source of inspiration to\nthe man that has seen big things happen to him over the past few years.\nThe current number 8 DJ in the critically acclaimed DJ Mag Top 100 was\nchosen 'Best American DJ' at the IDMA's, saw his 'Do You Dream' and 'The\nNew World' become the official anthems of two major events, unleashed his\nDakota alias with the 'Thoughts Become Things' album and kept his speed\nby clocking one fabulous gig after another. Anything does happen to\nMarkus Schulz.\n\nFor Markus Schulz, Las Vegas has been one of the most influential and\ninspirational cities he has played over the past 12 months. Markus:&quot;Las\nVegas has been a big part of my year. When it came time to pick the next\ncity in the series, it was the first one that came to me. There is this\nvibe in Vegas that anything is possible. Like the cab driver can hit the\nmillion dollar jackpot and tomorrow be living like a king. I wanted to\nbring the bling-bling, the over the top vibe that I feel every time I go\nthere, to my compilation.&quot;\n\nBling-bling may not be the first thing you associate 'Las Vegas '10'\nwith, but a selection of deep proggy beats and warm melodic infusions of\ntrance might do. Chunky, fresh tracks by upcoming talents like Shogun,\nSkytech and Ummet Ozcan set forth the Las Vegas sound and mingle amongst\nthe unreleased but 2010-defining tracks by names such as Max Graham, Mike\nFoyle, Arnej and Markus himself under his Dakota alias. With 'Las Vegas\n'10', Markus Schulz shows that what happens in Vegas, doesn't always have\nto stay there.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67e956b6cbc109dd030f8655ac5733e556ed7100","amp;dn":"VA-Las+Vegas+10+Mixed+By+Markus+Schulz-2CD-2010-TGX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67e956b6cbc109dd030f8655ac5733e556ed7100","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,233,86,182,203,193,9,221,3,15,134,85,172,87,51,229,86,237,113,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
