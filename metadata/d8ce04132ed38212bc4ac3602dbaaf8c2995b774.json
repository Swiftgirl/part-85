He also discusses some of his experience as an Army Captain during the Vietnam War, and his work with former CIA Director, William E. Colby.\n\n\n. . . .\n\n\n-- background --\n\n\n&quot;Conspiracy of Silence,&quot; a documentary film dealing with this case, was listed for viewing in TV Guide Magazine was to be aired on the Discovery Channel, on May 3, 1994. This documentary exposed a network of religious leaders and Washington politicians who flew children to Washington D.C. for sex orgies.\n\nMany children suffered the indignity of wearing nothing but their underwear and a number displayed on a piece of cardboard hanging from their necks when being auctioned off to foreigners in Las Vegas, Nevada and Toronto, Canada.\n\nAt the last minute before airing, unknown congressmen threatened the TV Cable industry with restrictive legislation if this documentary was aired. Almost immediately, the rights to the documentary were purchased by unknown persons who had ordered all copies destroyed.\n\nThe Omaha Herald led the media vilification of the kids. The FBI threatened the kids with perjury prosecution if they told their story, and after 2 recanted, they did put the one remaining who stuck to her story in prison. After the State's lead investigator Gary Caradori and his young son were killed in the unexplained breakup of his plane in midair the investigation died as other victims refused to talk or recanted their video testimony in court. This documentary picks up the pieces. \n\nA copy of this videotape was furnished anonymously to former Nebraska state senator and attorney John De Camp who made it available to retired FBI Agent Ted L. Gunderson. While the video quality is not top grade [said to be a copy of a work print], this tape is a blockbuster in what is revealed by the participants involved. \n\n\nThe video is available online:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://freedocumentaries.net/media/76/Conspiracy_of_Silence/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://freedocumentaries.net/media/76/Conspiracy_of_Silence/&lt;/a&gt;\nand a slightly longer version at\nas well as via various bit torrents, e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3988380/Conspiracy_Of_Silence_%5BMPEG_-_Government___Prostitution_Rings%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3988380/Conspiracy_Of_Silence_%5BMPEG_-_Government___Prostitution_Rings%5D&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n================================================\n\n&quot;Guns &amp; Butter&quot; investigates the relationships among capitalism, militarism and politics.
