The trio were successful for most of their forty years of recording music, but they had two distinct periods of exceptional success: as a harmonic &quot;soft rock&quot; act in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and as the foremost stars of the disco music era in the late 1970s. The group sang three-part tight harmonies that were instantly recognisable; brother Robin's clear vibrato lead was a hallmark of their earlier hits, while Barry's R&amp;B falsetto became a signature sound during the disco years. The three brothers co-wrote most of their own hits, as well as writing and producing several major hits for other artists.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7680539b2e35917c11752f6b5e13577fb8de9f92","amp;dn":"Bee+Gees+-+The+Woman+In+You+%28extended%29+-+Vinylrip+-+Abrasax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7680539b2e35917c11752f6b5e13577fb8de9f92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,128,83,155,46,53,145,124,17,117,47,107,94,19,87,127,184,222,159,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
