The first disc eschews the earlier John Foxx-led period and focuses on the later, Midge Ure-dominated and arguably more popular period. This later incarnation of the band was responsible for hits like 'Vienna' and 'All Stood Still', both present on this collection. The live material on the DVD features live performances from St Albans, as well as Top Of The Pops recordings and music videos for several songs.\n\n\n\nCD:\n\n\nSource.....: CD\nYear.......: 2009\nRipper.....: ExactAudioCopy v0.99pb4 &amp; PHILIPS DROM6216\nCodec......: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion....: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality....: Lossless, (avg. compression: )\nChannels...: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n\n\n\n01.
