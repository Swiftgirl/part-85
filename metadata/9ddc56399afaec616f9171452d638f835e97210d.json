Lots and lots of settings and options, making it possible to play Tetris in many different flavours.\n\nYou can select 8 different rotation rules.\n\nHEBORIS     : TGM1 and TGM2 style. Same as original heboris rotation.\nTI-ARS      : TGM3 style. T and I piece have special ground kick(It works only once!).\nTI-WORLD    : SRS, you can move 10 times, or rotate 8 times.\nACE-SRS     : SRS, you can move 128 times, or rotate 128 times \n              Fast drop is slower than TI-WORLD.\nACE-ARS     : TGM-ACE style rotation rule. Really strange! \n              Fast drop is slower than TI-ARS.\nACE-ARS2    : Same as ACE-ARS, except soft drop and hard drop. \n              Fast drop is slower than TI-ARS.\nDS-WORLD    : SRS, you can rotate or move infinity! \n              Fast drop is slower than TI-WORLD.\nSRS-X       : Original rotation rule based on SRS. But you can use Zangi-moves!\n               You can move 24 times, or rotate 12 times.\n               And C-botton is &quot;180 degree rotarion&quot; with original wall kicks. \nD.R.S       : If you have ever played DTET,let's use this!\n               Added T and I ground kick(only once!) to it.\n\n\nHere's an article about this game -&gt; http://followingrevolution.com/?p=561\n\nps. If you want to play with pad or stick, you might need joy2key or Xpadder.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ddc56399afaec616f9171452d638f835e97210d","amp;dn":"Heboris++C7V4EX+%28Tetris%29+-S7R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ddc56399afaec616f9171452d638f835e97210d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,220,86,57,154,250,236,97,111,145,113,69,45,99,143,131,94,151,33,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
