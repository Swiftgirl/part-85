Not only does it lack important details, but it's the exact same program found under another title, PCHeal--although it comes from a different publisher.\n\nThe program's user interface is way too simple for what it aims to do. It requires simply selecting your operating system and processor types from drop-down menus. A slidebar lets you adjust the repair settings, but the offerings are vague and range from &quot;Heal&quot; to &quot;Heal and Boost.&quot; Once the Go button is clicked, the program appears to go to work, repairing your system. Nowhere does the program list details of its findings and repairs. It would have been nice to have the option of seeing a report and manually selecting the repairs we wanted to include. On top of that, once the program completed its job, we found no discernible difference in our computer's performance.\n\nA Help file is included with the program, but it didn't change the fact that the program lacked important details and settings options. Just like its twin, PCHeal, we recommend that you skip PCMedik and keep looking for a more comprehensive system-optimization tool that doesn't leave you in the dark about what it's doing to your system.\n\n--------\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8ec1cd7a7c9beff336055791cbc2d25cf624225","amp;dn":"PcMedik+2010+%2B+Crack+%26+Serial+%5B1337x%5D+%5BAhmed%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8ec1cd7a7c9beff336055791cbc2d25cf624225","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,236,28,215,167,201,190,255,51,96,85,121,28,188,45,37,207,98,66,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
