The entire game environment will be visible from any level. Players can observe the environment, climb and fight enemies. Set in the late 1980s, players take on the role of a fearless mountaineer climbing in the Himalayas on a quest to find her lost brother. As you ascend a mountain he encounters an ancient curse: the souls of those who died in that region of the planet are being held in limbo, caught in the Shadow World. Villagers, pilgrims, mountaineers and Buddhist monks dead but not yet reincarnated are the only people living in the mountains. Terrible visions will disorient and ghosts and demons block his path. But the main question remains unanswered: his brother is still alive?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f95d5f887e3539d922b99761abde37c03d7b6ad","amp;dn":"Cursed+Mountain+%5BMULTI4%5D%5Bgamerguuy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f95d5f887e3539d922b99761abde37c03d7b6ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,149,213,248,135,227,83,157,146,43,153,118,26,189,227,124,3,215,182,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
