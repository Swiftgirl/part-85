This is what I use.\nVLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.\nOne can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.\nQuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.\nPS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.\nAnd please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).Many of movies I encode have embedded subtitles. So far, only VLC player is able to use them correctly.\n\nRelease Date: January 12, 2010\nSource: WS VHS\nGenre: Biography | Drama\nIMDB Rating: 5.8/10 (929 votes)\nRT Critics: 4.4/10 (140 reviews)\nDirected By: Mira Nair\nStarring: Hilary Swank, Richard Gere, Ewan McGregor, Christopher Eccleston\n\nA look at the life of legendary American pilot Amelia Earhart, who disappeared while flying over the Pacific Ocean in 1937 in an attempt to make a flight around the world.\n\nInput: Amelia.2009.WS.SCR.XviD-SilentNinja 1.38 GB\n\nDecent (quality-wise) screener except strong deinterlacing effects\nfrom &quot;mixed-bag&quot; called SilentNinja (who should learn to use decomb filter)...\n\nSample is included, download it first then decide.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab043efdc1cbf4bbfd33616c3575edf40eea8154","amp;dn":"Amelia.2009.VHSSCR.WS.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab043efdc1cbf4bbfd33616c3575edf40eea8154","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,4,62,253,193,203,244,187,253,51,97,108,53,117,237,244,14,234,129,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
