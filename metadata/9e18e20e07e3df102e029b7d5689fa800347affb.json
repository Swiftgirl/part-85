Armed only with the light in their heart and the post-encounter feeling that there is something more to what is perceived, they may embark on a journey of self-understanding and healing. They may be part of their own Caduceus Saga.\n\n\nThanks: Family, Lovers, Friends, CDBaby, Music-SUBMIT, DeviantART, strangers and all the artists who have inspired. There are too many of you to list.\n\nMusic by Neuron Dreamtime. Lyrics and vocals by L. Morris. Additional vocals on &quot;Just Looking For the Truth&quot; by M. Pachol.
