All songs were written by Angus Young, Malcolm Young, and Bon Scott.\n\nThe album was recorded live during the 1978 Powerage Tour and contains live versions of songs from AC/DC's T.N.T., Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, Let There Be Rock, and Powerage albums. It is the last Bon Scott-era AC/DC album produced by Harry Vanda and George Young, who also produced the band's first five studio releases. The album was ranked number two on Classic Rock magazine's readers' poll of &quot;50 Greatest Live Albums Ever&quot;. \n\nThe album was re-released in 1994 on Atco Records and in 2003 as part of the AC/DC Remasters series.\n\nHighway to Hell is the sixth studio album by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, released in July 1979.

On May 25 2006, Highway to Hell was certified 7x platinum by the RIAA. In 2003, the album was ranked number 199 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nIn 2010, this song came #4 in Triple M's Ultimate 500 Rock Countdown in Melbourne, Australia. The top five were all AC/DC songs.\n\nAC/DC are an Australian rock band formed in 1973 by brothers Malcolm and Angus Young. Although the band are commonly classified as hard rock and are considered a pioneer of heavy metal, they have always classified their music as rock and roll.\n\nAC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, High Voltage, in 1975. Membership remained stable until bassist Mark Evans was replaced by Cliff Williams in 1977 for the album Powerage. The band recorded their highly successful album Highway to Hell in 1979. Lead singer and co-songwriter Bon Scott died on 19 February 1980, after a night of heavy alcohol consumption. The group briefly considered disbanding, but soon ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson was selected to replace Scott. Later that year, the band released their best-selling album, Back in Black.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:078c8cf55c3bca0c1710d8c060291df1fdd35683","amp;dn":"AC%2FDC+-+If+You+Want+Blood+%28You%5C%27ve+Got+It%29++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"078c8cf55c3bca0c1710d8c060291df1fdd35683","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,140,140,245,92,59,202,12,23,16,216,192,96,41,29,241,253,211,86,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
