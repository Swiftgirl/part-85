The march, completed by only a fifth of the original army, was a defeat in all ways but one: it returned Mao from the political wilderness to power. Mao transformed the march into the founding myth of modern China and, in doing so, created a new narrative around victories that never happened. Shuyun, a Chinese-born BBC documentary producer, retraces the route and interviews the few remaining survivors, in an account that shows the human cost of MaoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s revisionism; along the way are huge memorials to spurious victories and countless unmarked graves of those who died in defeats that Mao later denied.
