Only Net activity, Memory usage and Disk read/write appear in a graphic format.\n\nDash Monitors is a Dashboard widget that displays a graphic summary of your system resource usage. It shows what percentage of CPU time is being used, the amount of memory in use, the speed at which the machine is transferring or receiving data over the network, and the speed the machine is reading and writing to local disk volumes. Dash Monitors is great for users who would like to run a system monitor but do not want to sacrifice any screen real-estate while working.\n\nMonitor Modes\n\nThere are 3 modes for each of the monitors: text, simple, and graphical. The text view mode shows a very simple text view of the resources being used and is beneficial because it takes very few system resources to generate the statistics. \n\nThe simple view mode is the original view from Dash Monitors 1.0, and includes simple bar charts to show statistics in a graphical way without th eye candy. The graphical view mode, while taking more CPU resources to draw all the monitors, displays a fully imaged graphical interface to what is happening on the system. Text summaries are provided with the monitors in simple and graphical mode to provide the exact data along with the graphical approximations.\n\nWhat's new:\nVersion 1.4\nFixed a compatibility problem with Safari 4 beta.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nOS X.4 and above\n\n--&gt;&gt; PLEASE SEED ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22b09f4eaad0b85df609d23d2fd14515816ebe24","amp;dn":"Dash+Monitor+Widget+1.4+with+CORE+keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22b09f4eaad0b85df609d23d2fd14515816ebe24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,176,159,78,170,208,184,93,246,9,210,61,47,209,69,21,129,110,190,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
