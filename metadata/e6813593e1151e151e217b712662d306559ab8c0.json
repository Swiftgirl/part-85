Tricked into believing that the Solar Empire is developing a devastating super-weapon, Commander Pierce and Colonel Windsor of the Anglo Isles launch a pre-emptive strike. General Herman and Brigadier Betty of the Western Frontier are on garrison duty in the Solar Empire when the Anglos strike, and assist Empress Lei-Qo and Admiral A-Qira in repelling the invaders. But as the nations of the world, including the Tundran Territories, are once again propelled into all-out conflict, it becomes clear that a shadowy figure is pulling the strings from afar.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6813593e1151e151e217b712662d306559ab8c0","amp;dn":"Battalion+Wars+2+%5BPAL%5D+%5BWiiTorrentZ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6813593e1151e151e217b712662d306559ab8c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,129,53,147,225,21,30,21,30,33,123,113,38,98,211,6,85,154,184,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
