Hence the band name Anterrabae, for example. In the proto-chick-lit novel I Never Promised You a Rose Garden, Anterrabae was the name of a god forever falling to earth in a shower of fire ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ at several different levels, an irresistible name for a hardcore band that aspires to depth. Hence also the faux-sophisticated album title And Our Heart Beat in Our Fingertips, Without Reason, and song titles like &quot;I Lifted Her Dress over Her Head and Unscrewed Her Leg&quot; and &quot;My Wrists Are Rivers, My Fingers Are Words.&quot; Musically, this stuff is actually lots of fun: there are plenty of unusual and challenging song patterns (note the 5/4 intro and subsequent structured chaos of &quot;The Filthy Habits of Ex.Lovers&quot;) and the subtle complexity churning beneath the surface noise on both &quot;Pink &amp; Tender&quot; and &quot;Stay Moist.&quot; The instrumental bits offer some of the most powerful moments on the album, but the tag-team screaming (and, hey, singing!) on &quot;I Lifted Her Dress and Unscrewed Her Leg&quot; is also very effective. Good stuff, and it would be even better without the crust of whoa-dude pseudo-philosophy on top.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71740a9fe2666f15a9231e8c9aac834057d58827","amp;dn":"Anterrabae-And+our+Heart+Beat+in+our+Fingertips%2CWithout+Reason","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71740a9fe2666f15a9231e8c9aac834057d58827","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,116,10,159,226,102,111,21,169,35,30,140,154,172,131,64,87,213,136,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
