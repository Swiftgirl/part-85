She knows that today's women are &quot;Fabulous&quot;. They have the job, the house, the colour-co-ordinated capsule wardrobe; they cope with singledom, marriage and having kids with peanut allergies; and they all do it effortlessly, with nothing more than a copy of Prima and a poem by Pam Ayres to guide them. So Faye wonders why she can't pull it off. \n\nFabulous unearths the slightly unhinged madwoman that lurks behind this &quot;having it all&quot; fantasy. The sitcom follows Faye as she tries to get through her day with her &quot;fabulous&quot; facade intact.\n\nwww.comedy.co.uk Review: \n\nQuote:The first series of this sitcom provided some bite-sized amusement to the ears, but this was somewhat at the expense of men (portrayed, in the main, as idiots).\n\nThe episodes in the second series were extended to thirty minutes each, allowing time for longer adventures and some new characters to be introduced (more ineffectual men!).\n\nSome felt this second series was an improvement on the first. However, on reflection, we think we preferred the first series more. The comedy was stronger when the focus was more squarely on the battle between Faye and her boss Edith.\n\n\nCast:\nDaisy Haggard\nAdam Buxton\nKaty Brand\nMatthew Holness\nOlivia Colman\nLaura Solon\nEve Dallas\nJoanna Scanlan\nJoanna Neary\nAnne Reid\nJustin Edwards\n\n\nThanks to Muttley &amp; Dearleuk for the missing eps.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/fabulous/episodes/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/fabulous/episodes/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFabulous - S01 - E01\nFabulous - S01 - E02 \nFabulous - S01 - E03\nFabulous - S01 - E04 \nFabulous - S01 - E05 \nFabulous - S01 - E06 \n\nFabulous - S02 - E01\nFabulous - S02 - E02\nFabulous - S02 - E03\nFabulous - S02 - E04\n\nFabulous - S03 - E01\nFabulous - S03 - E02\nFabulous - S03 - E03\nFabulous - S03 - E04\n\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration Approx : 27 &amp; 13mn 31s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98d9f242c8a063f12ebd20009613fe015962401a","amp;dn":"Fabulous+-+Series+01+to+03+-+Audio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98d9f242c8a063f12ebd20009613fe015962401a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,217,242,66,200,160,99,241,46,189,32,0,150,19,254,1,89,98,64,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
