By optimizing as many routines as possible without losing user friendliness, Notepad++ is trying to reduce the world carbon dioxide emissions. When using less CPU power, the PC can throttle down and reduce power consumption, resulting in a greener environment.\n\nThis project is mature. However, there may be still some bugs and missing features that are being worked on.\n\nI hope you enjoy Notepad++ as much as I enjoy coding it.\n\n\nHere are the features of Notepad++ :\n\n\nSyntax Highlighting and Syntax Folding \n\nSupported languages:\n\nC\nC++\nJava\nC#\nXML\nHTML\nPHP\nCSS\nmakefile\nASCII art (.nfo)\ndoxygen\nini file\nbatch file\nJavascript\nASP\nVB/VBS\nSQL\nObjective-C\nRC resource file\nPascal\nPerl\nPython\nLua\nTeX\nTCL\nAssembler\nRuby\nLisp\nScheme\nProperties\nDiff\nSmalltalk\nPostscript\nVHDL\nAda\nCaml\nAutoIt\nKiXtart\nMatlab\nVerilog\nHaskell\nInnoSetup\nCMake\nYAML\n\n\nWYSIWYG \n\nIf you have a colour printer, print your source code (or whatever you want) in colour.\n\n\nUser Defined Syntax Highlighting \n\nIt allows user to define his own language : not only the syntax highlighting keywords, but also the syntax folding keywords, comment keywords and the operators.\n\n\nAuto-completion \n\nFor most supported languages, user can make his/her own API list.\nOnce the api file is ready, type Ctrl+Space to launch this action.\n\n\nMulti-Document \n\nYou can edit several documents at the same time.\n\n\nMulti-View \n\nYou have two views at same time. That means you can visualize (edit) 2 different documents at the same time. You can visualize (edit) in the 2 views one document at 2 different positions as well. The modification of document in one view will carry out in another view (i.e. you modify the SAME document when you are in clone mode). \n\n\nRegular Expression Search/Replace supported \n\nYou can search and replace one string in the document by using the regular expression.\n\n\nFull Drag ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“N' Drop supported \n\nYou can open a document by drag &amp; drop.\nYou can also move your document from a position (or even a view) to another by drag &amp; drop. \n\n\nDynamic position of Views \n\nThe user can set the position of the views dynamically (only in 2 views mode : the splitter can be set in horizontal or in vertical). \n\n\nFile Status Auto-detection \n\nIf you modify or delete a file which opened in Notepad++, you will be notified to update your document (reload the file or remove the file). \n\n\nZoom in and zoom out \n\nThat's another fantastic function of Scintilla component.\n\n\nMulti-Language environment supported \n\nThe Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic and Hebrew Windows environments are supported.\n\n\nBookmark \n\nUser can just click on the bookmark margin (located right side of line number margin) or type Ctrl+F2 to toggle a book mark.\nTo reach the bookmark, type just F2 (Next bookmark) or Shift+F2 (Previous bookmark). To clear all bookmarks, click the Menu Search-&gt;Clear All bookmarks.\n\n\nBrace and Indent guideline Highlighting \n\nWhen the caret stay beside of one of those symbol { } [ ] ( ) , the symbol beside of caret and its symmetric opposite symbol will be highlighted, as well as the indent guideline (if any) in order to locate the block more easily.\n\n\nMacro recording and playback \n\nYou can save several macros and edit their keyboard shorcuts for the next use.\n\n\nChangelog:\n\n\nNotepad++ v5.6.4 new features and fixed bugs (from v5.6.3) :\n\n\nAdd feature of conversion from a localization encoding to UNICODE.\n\n\nFix status bar display bug that xml/html utf8 indicator makes status bar display ANSI instead of ANSI as UTF-8.\n\n\n\nNotepad++ v5.6.3 new features and fixed bugs (from v5.6.2) :\n\n\nAdd restore button in fullscreen and postIt mode.\n\n\nFix auto-updater bug.\n\n\n\nNotepad++ v5.6.2 new features and fixed bugs (from v5.6.1) :\n\n\nFix the Unicode localization file display problem.\n\n\nUpdate template localization file (english.xml) to v5.6.1.\n\n\nFix tag highlighting bug while disabling indent guide lines.\n\nFix the translated sub menu entries applying on the menu item.\n\n\nDisplay more information while catching of plugins crash.\n\n\n\nNotepad++ v5.6.1 new features and fixed bugs (from v5.6) :\n\n\nFix brace highlighting breaking issue and related performance problem.\n\n\nAdd new encodings in the shortcuts map.\n\n\nRemove annoying encoding issue warning dialogs.\n\n\nEnhance Html encoding auto-detection.\n\n\nFix case-insensitive searching bug for non-ascii characters\n(for example some characters in French and Cyrillic letters).\n\n\nAdd find result commands in the menu.\n\nAdd DOS CodePage : CP437, CP737, CP850, CP852, CP855, CP857, CP858, CP860, CP861, CP863, CP865, CP866 and CP869.\n\n\nFix localization combo box unselected in preference dialog bug after startup\n(when a localization file is in use).\n\n\n\nNotepad++ v5.6 new features and fixed bugs (from v5.5.1) :\n\n\nAdd languages encoding - Chinese traditional (BIG5), Chinese Simplified (GB2312), Japanese (Shift JIS), Korean (EUC), Thai (TIS-620), Hebrew (iso-8859-8), Hebrew (1255), Central European (1250), Cyrillic (1251), Cyrillic (KOI8-U), Cyrillic (KOI8-R), Cyrillic (Mac), Western European(1252), Greek (1253), Turkish(1254), Arabic (1256), Baltic (1257), Vietnamese (1258), ISO_8859-1 to ISO_8859-16 and a lot of more.\n\nAdd auto-detection of HTML and XML files encodings.\n\nAdd COBOL, D, Gui4Cli, PowerShell and R language support.\n\nAdd Marker Jumper feature (Jump down/up : Ctrl+Num/Ctrl+Shift+Num).\n\nAdd indent guide line highlighting for html/xml tags.\n\nAdd system tray context menu and new command argument &quot;-systemtray&quot;.\n\n\nFix Unicode to ANSI encoding bug.\n\nFix last recent file list menu items localization encoding bug.\n\nFix last recent file number goes to zero issue.\n\n\nAdd new command argument &quot;--help&quot;.\n\n\nFix Calltip hint bug and add a new capacity in it.\n\n\nAdd the ability to add the second keyword group for user in both LISP and Scheme languages.\n\n\nFix the wrap symbol display problem.\n\n\nAdd SQL ESC symbol ''.\n\n\nFix column editor insert number bug in virtual space mode.\n\nFix status bar displaying &quot;-2 char&quot; issue for a empty document.\n\nFix installation of NppShell64 failed issue in installer.\n\n\n\nNotepad++ v5.5.1 new features and fixed bugs (from v5.5) :\n\n\nOld icon is back.\n\n\nSet &quot;.txt&quot; extension automatically while saving a document text.\n\n\nReal characters count is added in status bar.\n\n\nFix some memory leaks.\n\n\nAdd &quot;open all&quot; capacity in finder (for find in files).\n\nReplaced nppcm with NppShell (in installer).\n- Dialog to allow change of various settings (cmd : regsvr32 /s /i NppShell.dll)\n- Context menu icon properly rendered\n- Incorporate dynamic icon for registered filetypes\n\n\n\nIncluded plugins (Unicode):\n\n1.
