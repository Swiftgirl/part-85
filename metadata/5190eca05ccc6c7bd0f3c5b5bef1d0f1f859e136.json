One \n\nThe music of Creed was born out of the strife and tumult of singer Scott Stapp's personal life. He turned down a university scholarship and left home at 17, estranging himself from his parents, whose strict religious mindset he had been at odds ... Full Descriptionwith for years. Eventually, he hit bottom, living in a car and scribbling down the ideas that became the lyrics to Creed songs. The mainstream success of MY OWN PRISON has taken Stapp and his fellow Floridians in Creed a long way from dumpster-diving. \n\nThe band's combination of spiritually-oriented lyrics and guitar-based post-Nirvana hard rock connected in a big way with rock radio and with their vast, rabid following. MY OWN PRISON reflects the band's belief in the redemptive power of both God and rock and roll. On such tunes as &quot;In America,&quot; &quot;What's This Life For&quot; and &quot;Pity For A Dime&quot; the band expresses both sociopolitical and spiritual concerns while leaving plenty of room for world-class headbanging riffs. \n\nRecorded at The Kitchen Studio, Tallahassee, Florida and Criteria Studios, Miami, Florida. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n\n \n \n \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5190eca05ccc6c7bd0f3c5b5bef1d0f1f859e136","amp;dn":"Creed+-+My+Own+Prison+%28EAC.FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5190eca05ccc6c7bd0f3c5b5bef1d0f1f859e136","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,144,236,160,92,204,108,123,208,243,197,181,190,241,208,241,248,89,225,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
