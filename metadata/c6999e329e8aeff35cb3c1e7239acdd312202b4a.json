Most people (just like me when I started) don't know how to do this. It simply means that when the download is complete, don't press stop or close down your program. It will then be available to anyone who wants to download it from you. Thanks.\n\nUrgent Backup is very easy to set up and extremely easy to use. You do not have to have any special knowledge or particular skills, you just need to install the program, set up the time schedule for copying the information from your hard disk, and indicate which disk you are using for storing the backup copy. And thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s it! \n\nFrom that point on, you wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have to be afraid of a computer crash or any other kind of problem. In the event of data loss you will not have any difficulty restoring the lost information, and this can save not only time, but a great deal of money as well!\n\nUrgent Backup can be used to synchronize data between your work and home computers or between computers located in different offices. You always are able to continue any project you are working on remotely from your primary work site. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6999e329e8aeff35cb3c1e7239acdd312202b4a","amp;dn":"Urgent+Backup+3.20","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6999e329e8aeff35cb3c1e7239acdd312202b4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,153,158,50,158,138,239,243,92,179,193,231,35,154,205,211,18,32,43,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
