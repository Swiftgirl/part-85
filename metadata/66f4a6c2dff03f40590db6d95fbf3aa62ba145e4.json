(No offense intended). I ALSO INCLUDED A SMALL INFO ON INSTALLING ON WINDOWS VISTA or 7 IN STEP 5. AND I MADE LONG URLS EASIER FOR NOOBS TO COPY CORRECTLY BY CONVERTING TO THEM TO SHORT &quot;.sexings.com&quot; FORMAT.\n\nFIRST OF ALL: If you install as below, and get a new version update newer than this package (and you will through the EA Installer) - then you NEED to get the CRACK for THAT version. Try http://www.gamecopyworld.com for cracks. Or google it.\n\nThe game SHOULD update to correct version itself if installed as the instructions below, but if you have problems updating to new version you need to MANUALLY update and install the patches for newer version. \n\nFind newest version patch at: http://sims3wa-patches.sexings.com/\nUse the Region 2 patches! Patch from v2.5.12 and upwards (2.5.12 is the version you get by installing THIS package from this torrent). REMEMBER TO APPLY A CRACK FOR THE VERSION YOU INSTALLED AS MENTIONED ABOVE. ALSO THIS IS FOR THE FULL INSTALLATION OF WORLD ADVENTURES! IF YOU ONLY INSTALL SIMS 3 YOU WILL GET A DIFFERENT VERSION NUMBER AND NEED TO UPDATE THAT IF YOU WISH TO PLAY ONLY SIMS 3 version 1.10.6 WITHOUT WORLD ADVENTURES: http://sims3patches.sexings.com/ \nAGAIN, SIMPLY UPDATE FROM THE VERSION YOU HAVE - v1.10.6 - AND APPLY THE PATCHES IN CORRECT ORDER UPWARDS TO THE LATEST PATCH VERSION! THEN FIND A CRACK FOR THAT VERSION ON http://www.GameCopyWorld.com or elsewhere (google it).\n\nMarch 15, 2010: UPDATED INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS BELOW! THNX TO CRoWsNeST25 FOR POINTING OUT THE ERROR! (Regarding the installation of store items etc, the dbc files) - \n\nALSO IF AWESOMEMOD IS EXPIRED UPDATE IT AT: http://awesomemod.sexings.com/ - for some sucky reason the creators of awesomemod have made it so it will expire all the time and need to be redownloaded (Assbuggers! But good mod) - TO AVOID THIS PROBLEM YOU CAN SIMPLY IGNORE THE PART WHERE YOU INSTALL AWESOMEMOD AS YOU DO NOT NEED THIS - IT IS A MOD, AN EXTRA, NOT PART OF THE OFFICIAL GAME!\n\n\nALL in one package, with full instructions on how to install:\n\nSt-Thomas Release of THE SIMS 3 + WORLD ADVENTURES + STOREOBJECTS+MODS+PATCHES\n\nThis is the FULL The Sims 3 with the expansaion pack World Adventures.\nIn addition ALL store objects until January 2010 are added.\nSome mods are also included, such as Awesomemod, and uncensor patches.\n\nThe latest available patches are also included, meaning you will have Sims 3 v 1.10.6 and with World Adventrues v 2.5.12 (UPDATE MAY 19: New version available, see above main update)\n\nFOLLOW THESE EXACT INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS TO GET THE GAME WORKING AND ALL EXTRAS INCLUDED WITHOUT PROBLEMS:\n\n1. \nMount The Sims 3 iso with PowerIso. If the installation window for the game comes up, let it for now. Open the Drive the ISO is mounted on and open the cracks folder. Rld-sims3.exe is the KeyGen you need to run now.\n\n2. \nNow install The Sims 3 using the KeyGen. When asked for installing the EA Download Manager deselect it, do not install this.\n\n3. \nUNRAR the full content of Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â«Sims 3 reload patch.rarÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» (found in &quot;sims3sims3update&quot; folder) directly into your main Sims 3 installation path (For example Program FilesElectronic ArtsThe Sims 3)\n\nClick YES if asked to overwrite any files. Simply chose Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â«yes to allÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» on overwrite.\n\n4. \nNow mount the Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â«Sims 3 World Adventure.ISOÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» file. Close the installation window if it comes up. Go to Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â«GameBinÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» path by opening the ISO on the Mounted drive. There, COPY the whole Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â«HelpPagesÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» directory, then go back to where you installed your Sims 3 on your computer, go into the same Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â«gamesbinÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» folder there and PASTE the HelpPages directory from the Sims 3 World Adventures there. Overwrite any files if asked.\n\n5. \nWindows XP:\nType in REGEDIT from Start Menu &gt; Run and do this:\n1. Go to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWARESimsThe Sims 3\n2. You will see a bunch of information to the right. Look for Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â«SKUÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» which has a numerical string that ends on 7. Simply doubleclick the Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â«SKUÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» icon under Value Name, and change 7 to 2 - Close Regedit.\n3. OK, refresh, then restart your computer.\n\nWindows Vista / Windows 7:\n1. Go to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREWow6432NodeSimsThe Sims 3\n2. Choose Value Name: SKU ,and double click to change the Value Data to: 2.\n3. OK, refresh, then restart your computer.\n\n\n6. Now you can apply all the patches in correct order. I have added all the patches, but you should have version 1.0.631, and thus really just need to run the patch called Sims3_1.8.25.003002_from_1.0.631.00002.exe first, then take the next called Sims3_1.9.22.004002_from_1.8.25.003002.exe and finally Sims3_1.10.6.004002_from_1.9.22.004002.exe\n\nThis should install the necessary patches to the latest version without any problems if all the above is followed as per my instructions.\n\n7. \nNow you have installed full retail version of Sims 3, latest patch version 1.10.6, and you can now install the World Adventures expansion pack. Do as follows:\n\n8. \nSince the Sims 3 World Adventures ISO should still be mounted at this time, just run the autorun.exe file on its drive. Or simply re-mount and it should start automatically. Install the whole package - this time DO install EA Update Manager as well.\n\n9.\nNow start the game, with the ISO still mounted, and go to the Game Updates button at bottom of the Game Launcher. Click Refresh if no update is seen, and it should show up at top to update your game to v 2.5.12 - Click Update Now and let the automatic update do its thing. (MAY 19 UPDATE: PLEASE READ THE TOP OF THIS PAGE AS NEW VERSION IS OUT)\n\nIF YOU HAVE v2.5.12 do the following, if you have newer version do NOT do this but find the crack for YOUR version:\nOnce that is done, uncheck Automatic Updates, close the Game Launcher, and open the file called 2.5.12 crack.7z in the Sims 3 World Adventures folder of this package. Copy the Exe and the DLL files there (extract them) by going into your Sims 3 main installation folder, then go into Game, then Bin - here is where they should go, and overwrite the old exe and dll. Do the exact same thing on the installation folder of Sims 3 World Adventures (the installation of this expansion pack puts the exe in both places so both needs to be replaced with this crack).\n(MAY 19 UPDATE: SINCE A NEW VERSION IS OUT, YOU NEED TO FIND A DIFFERENT CRACK AS EXPLAINED ABOVE ON TOP OF THIS PAGE - http://www.GameCopyWorld.com is one place to look)\n\nIn Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â«Add / Remove programsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» select the EA Update Manager and remove and uninstall it. Do not install it again and do never let your game be updated if asked unless you want to screw it up.\n\nCONGRATULATIONS, You now have a FULL working version of Sims 3 with World Adventures, latest version at moment of writing this (March 02, 2010).\n\nAGAIN IMPORTANT UPDATE REGARDING THE VERSION OF THE GAME:\nIF your game is updated to anything ELSE than v.2.5.12 by using the automatic update mentioned in this step, it means you need to get the crack for the specific version you got updated to. OR you can simply download the v.2.5.12 update patch somewhere online using google and stay there and then apply my crack. However, if you want get updated to a newer version than what is currently available as I write this, you need to get the crack if you want it to run. You can go to www.gamecopyworld.com for cracks (NoDVD cracks) for the game.\n\nNow for the rest of the goodies:\n\nALL store objects and items from EA for the Sims 3 and Sims 3 World Adventures, up to January 2010:\n\nGo to the folder Sims3StoreCC in this package, copy all the dcdb files (dcdb0.dbc, dcdb1.dbc, dcdb2.dbc, dcdb3.dbc)\n\nPASTE these files into: My documents  Electronic Arts  The Sims 3  DCCache\n\nAND go to your Sims 3 main installation folder (For example: Program Files  Electronic Arts  The sims 3\n\nand create a NEW folder called Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â«ModsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â», and within it another subfolder called Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â«packagesÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» and within the &quot;packages&quot; folder, create another subfolder called &quot;dbc&quot; , then PASTE the same files mentioned above (the dcdb files) into this folder as well (For example: Program Files  Electronic Arts  The sims 3  Mods  packages   dbc )\n\nGo back to the main Sims 3 installation folder (For example: Program Files  Electronic Arts  The sims 3 ) and copy the Resource.cfg file from Sims3StoreCC into that above folder as well.\n\nCopy Riverwiew.world into your Sims 3 installations folder named (assuming you are using Program Files etc as the main installation folder) : Program FilesElectronic ArtsThe Sims 3GameDataSharedNonPackagedWorlds\n\nNow you have ALL extra store items, as well as the new world Riverview. Now go to My DocumentsElectronic ArtsThe Sims 3 and delete the file called scriptCache.package\n\nOk, now the FINAL step of the installation of all files and mods in this package:\n\n10:\nGo to  Sims 3Simsmods in this package. Unzip the awezome.zip and Carrigon_NoRepomanTS3.rar into the Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â«ModsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» folder I previously told you how to create. But make a subfolder in it called Packages, and move the files into this Packages folder.\n\nCopy Uncensored Patch.package to the same Packages folder. (Should look like: Program Files  Electronic Arts  The sims 3  Mods  Packages )\n\nUNRAR (extract) the framework.zip file directly into you main Sims 3 and Sims 3 World Adventure folders (such as Program Files  Electronic Arts  The sims 3  and Program Files  Electronic Arts  The sims 3 Word Adventures) and overwrite any files if asked.\n\nYOU ARE DONE MY FRIEND! Read the instructions for the Awesomemod in its own zip file.\n\nNOW you can start the game, and everything should be fine. You should have all objects and store items, the newest updated version, and a special fixed version of Awesomemod which I hacked as I and others experienced graphics problems with the original one (causing red blocks and dark areas and other glitches). This version should work FLAWLESSY as it has been tested and verified.\n\nHOPE YOU APPRECIATE MY EFFORTS IN GETTING YOU ALL THIS MATERIAL AND PUTTING IT TOGETHER SO NEATLY AND EASY FOR YOU TO PROPERLY INSTALL! THIS IS THE RIGHT AND ONLY CORRECT WAY TO INSTALL SIMS 3, WORLD ADVENTURES, and the additional Riverview World, Store objects, and mods.\n\nI also hope the new updated installation instructions are clear enough for anyone to understand and get the game working at newest version (at moment of writing this is actually 2.6.11 and you have all resources here to always get the newest version through the links mentioned above)\n\nBest regards, St-Thomas","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66f4a6c2dff03f40590db6d95fbf3aa62ba145e4","amp;dn":"Sims+3+%2B+World+Adventures+%2B+All+store+items+%2B+patches+%2B+rivervie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66f4a6c2dff03f40590db6d95fbf3aa62ba145e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,244,166,194,223,240,63,64,89,13,182,217,95,191,58,166,43,161,69,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
