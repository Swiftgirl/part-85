What Really Happened is proud to be one of the oldest political blogs on the net.\nRivero runs the WhatReallyHappened radio show on GCN six days a week, and makes good use of his sharp wit to help his blog visitors and radio listeners not only to read/hear the news but to understand what IS really happening. \n\n===============================================================\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be3234be7d34b17f95c6083a9ebeb1f7a7eaeef6","amp;dn":"What+Really+Happened+-+2010+Feb+04+TH+%5Bsebaygo1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be3234be7d34b17f95c6083a9ebeb1f7a7eaeef6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,50,52,190,125,52,177,127,149,198,8,58,158,190,177,247,167,234,238,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
