Her claims were taken so seriously that MI5 became involved. But was she really a threat to national security, and were the ghosts of wartime servicemen telling her secrets she should never have known?\n\nFrom the production House, FlashBack:\n\nThis series will bring a rational investigative approach to the world of psychic mysteries and the myths and legends of the past.\n\nEach episode of TONY ROBINSON &amp; ... centres on a case where information about the past has been derived from a source beyond our normal understanding, whether clairvoyance, psychic archaeology, past life regression or some other means. They are striking cases which embody our fascination with the great mysteries of the past.\n\nThe three stories featured in this series focus upon; a respected Edwardian archaeologist whose career is destroyed when he claims to be in direct contact with the dead monks of Glastonbury; a WW2 medium who apparently sees too much and is hunted down by MI5; and a group of strangers who seem to have shared a past life experience of a 12th century slaughter.\n\nHistorical research, archaeological investigation and rigorous examination of the facts are applied in each case. Historical context is explored and tested, to examine the details. Psychic techniques are studied and analysed for signs of fakery, delusion or alternative explanations. Myths and legends are probed to find the roots of their hold on our imagination.\n\nTony will be joined by fellow investigator, science journalist Becky McCall. He will meet and join forces with experts and fellow investigators where he needs to, to find the specialist answers heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s looking for. He will use a loose group of psychics, historians and scientists to advise on the investigations carried out, and understand the phenomena in question.\n\nVideotext in association with Flashback Television are producing the series, and the Executive Producers are Tim Taylor and Taylor Downing. David Edgar is Series Producer. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.fbtvonline.co.uk/news/6/53/Tony-Robinson.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.fbtvonline.co.uk/news/6/53/Tony-Robinson.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n  ____                      _                      _   _       _\n / ___|___  _ __  ___ _ __ (_)_ __ __ _  ___ _   _| | | |_   _| |__\n| |   / _ \\| '_ \\/ __| '_ \\| | '__/ _` |/ __| | | | |_| | | | | '_ \\\n| |__| (_) | | | \\__ \\ |_) | | | | (_| | (__| |_| |  _  | |_| | |_) |\n \\____\\___/|_| |_|___/ .__/|_|_|  \\__,_|\\___|\\__, |_| |_|\\__,_|_.__/\n                     |_|                     |___/\n   ____\n  / ___|___  _ __ ___\n | |   / _ \\| '_ ` _ \\\n | |__| (_) | | | | | |\n(_)____\\___/|_| |_| |_|\n\n\nPLEASE KEEP SEEDED TO PASS ON THE MESSAGE.
