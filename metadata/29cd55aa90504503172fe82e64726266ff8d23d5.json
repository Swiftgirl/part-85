These aspects include: protecting schools, cadet training, peacekeeping, ERT, remote policing, drug labs, youth policing, frontline policing, VIPs etc.\n\n\nEpisode Info: In the 21st century, crime no longer respects borders. Under the RCMP's International Peace Operations Branch, Canadian Police Officers are serving on peace missions in a dozen countries around the world. A new contingent of Canadian officers has just landed in Haiti, the poorest country in the Western hemisphere. There they will be faced with extreme poverty, heat and civil unrest.\n\nThe resolution is 592x336 and the quality is quite watchable in my opinion. The broadcast was HD but because of my conversion method, it is not as high quality as scene HD releases so I have labeled it as WS instead of HDTV.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29cd55aa90504503172fe82e64726266ff8d23d5","amp;dn":"Courage.in.Red.S01E03.Peace.Ops.WS.XviD-err0001.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29cd55aa90504503172fe82e64726266ff8d23d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,205,85,170,144,80,69,3,23,47,232,46,100,114,98,102,255,141,35,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
