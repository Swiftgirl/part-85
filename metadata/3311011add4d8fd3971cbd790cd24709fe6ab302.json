They are given the inside track, learn the harsh \n       realities of just how Britain's shameless confidence tricksters \n       set out to con people, and help to warn the public what to watch \n       out for.\n       \n       The hustlers go shopping for expensive sports cars and drive away \n       with their biggest pay day yet. Alex, Paul and Jess teach Danny \n       Dyer the ropes as he becomes the first celebrity hustler, and Paul \n       and Jess discover a miracle smoking cure that has punters queueing \n       up to buy.\n\n\n\n\n       Proper Notes: Apart from being mislabeled, W4F's release has \n       multiple video glitches, examples at 02:10, 02:19, 13:34, 16:36, \n       20:59, 22:45...\n\n       Proof of mislabel: http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00pzf30 \n       note the &quot;Series 8: Undercover&quot;.\n\n\n                             Big up all scene massive!\n\n\n    \n                                       \n                GROUP  INFORMATION          \n         9 Years of the Force and still    \n                      going strong                  \n     \n\n           What we are looking for:\n\n           * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n           * 100mbit or gigabit archive sites for TV/XVID/ETC\n           * 1080p or 720p rippers pre retail or classics\n           * Fios cappers in u.s\n           * U.K or Pre Retail Dvdrippers\n           * Internal 100mbit 1tb+ dump sites for Exlusive group usage\n           * If you think you can help contact us on irc\n           * or email us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;0b4d6479686e4b637e7863256a62&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3311011add4d8fd3971cbd790cd24709fe6ab302","amp;dn":"The.Real.Hustle.S08E01.PROPER.WS.PDTV.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3311011add4d8fd3971cbd790cd24709fe6ab302","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,17,1,26,221,77,143,211,151,28,189,121,12,210,71,9,254,106,179,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
