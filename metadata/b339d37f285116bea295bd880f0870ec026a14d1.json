Joe Linwood is a trained warrior, but he never expected he'd be doing battle on vacation. \nBut that's just what happens when the hotel Joe and his wife are staying at is violently overtaken. The target: the hotel's billionaire \nowner. But they won't hesitate to kill anyone who threatens to derail their diabolical plan, including Joe's wife. Now, with precious little \ntime to lose, Joe prepares to take on a small army of gun-toting thugs and rescue his wife before it's too late. ~ Jason Buchanan, \n\n\n\nM P A A R A T I N G * * * \n\nRated PG-13 for brief strong language and some sensuality. \n\n\nR E T A I L R E L E A S E D A T E * * *\n29 December 2009 (\n\nT O R R E N T R E L E A S E D A T E * * *\n01/12/10\n\n\n\nD V D C o n t e n t * * * \n\nMain Movie ******:\n* Video -3215 Kbps - 5 Passes - Widescreen ORIGINAL FILM\nVideo: Enchanced Widescreen Letterbox for 16x9 TV\nAudio: Dolby Digital w/ sub-woofer channel\nDolby Surround (4.0)\nLanguage: English, Spanish, French\nSubtitles: Spanish\n\n\nMenu ************:\n* Yes\nDVD Menu\n\nSet Up\nAudio Option: English Stereo\nSubtitle Options: English\nSubtitle Options: None\nScene Selection\n\nExtras/Special Features **********:\nNone on Original Disk\nRemoved **********:\nTrailers, warnings, adverts\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b339d37f285116bea295bd880f0870ec026a14d1","amp;dn":"The+Marine+2+%282009%29_DVD-R_NTSC_WS_Eng+%5Bclwilson1977%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b339d37f285116bea295bd880f0870ec026a14d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,57,211,127,40,81,22,190,162,149,189,136,15,8,112,236,2,106,20,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
