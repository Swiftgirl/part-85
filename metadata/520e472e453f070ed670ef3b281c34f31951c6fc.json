As i have given out the Magnet Link direct on xSellize, if that *should* impact on seeders shown, i'm not sure then. Cause as of now, 1:07AM GMT +12, it has 10 seeds.\n\nFrom TehRandomGuy on xSellize.com.\nThis IS the 8 Feb 2010 one, i made this torrent due to it being EXTREMELY slow with the direct downloads supplied. I am aware there are newer DLCs, get them at xSellize or here: http://xsellize.com/showthread.php/83375-Tap-Tap-Revenge-3-1-xSellize-Edition\n\n----------------------------------------\n Tap Tap Revenge 3.1 xSellize/Sinful Edition\n\n    First came the original Wizard Edition, running on 3.0, by vikingwizardeyes. Next came my own Pirate Edition for 3.0.1. Later, there was the massive Tapster Edition for 3.1 compiled by aashrey99. And now is the xSellize Edition under 3.1, named in honor of all the users that have made this possible. The new xSellize Edition holds all the premium track packs to date, all cracked and tested. In addition, a recently made Sinful Edition was made, which holds all of the imports plus some of the themed songs no longer available for free download.\n\n    Special thanks to hazelgu for providing the cracked TTR3.1 and everyone else who contributed towards the track packs.\n\n    Tap Tap Revenge xSellize Edition\n\n    UPDATED(Feb. 5 2010)\n\n    Download link\n\n    Update includes: Fixed Seconds to Mars theme and contains the new David Guetta theme\n\n    Tracks include:\n\n    30 Seconds to Mars:\n    Attack &amp; The Kill\n\n    A Perfect Circle:\n    Weak and Powerless &amp; Judith\n\n    AFI:\n    Miss Murder &amp; Girl's Not Grey\n\n    Airborne Toxic Event:\n    Wishing Well &amp; Sometime Around Midnight\n\n    All-American Rejects:\n    Move Along &amp; Gives You Hell\n\n    Angel &amp; Airwaves:\n    The Adventure &amp; Everything's Magic\n\n    Asher Roth:\n    I Love College &amp; Lark On My Go-Kart\n\n    Ben Harper:\n    Steal My Kisses &amp; Keep It Together (So I Can Fall Apart)\n\n    Blink-182:\n    First Date; The Rock Show; Adam's Song; All the Small Things; What's My Age Again &amp; Dammit\n\n    Bush:\n    Glycerine &amp; Machinehead\n\n    Coconut Records:\n    Nighttiming &amp; West Coast\n\n    Coldplay:\n    Viva la Vida &amp; Loves in Japan (Osaka Sun Mix)\n\n    The Crystal Method:\n    Busy Child &amp; Keep Hope Alive\n\n    Dashboard Confessional:\n    Vindicated &amp; Hands Down\n\n    David Guetta:\n    Gettin' Over (feat.

In addition Walk Away and Kiss With a Fist has been added, since they are also not available anymore.\n\n    Includes:\n\n        * All tracks listed in the xSellize Edition\n\n        * Coldplay Revenge, Lady Gaga Revenge, NIN Revenge, Metallica Revenge and Tap Tap Dance imports.\n\n        * Medicate - AFI\n\n        * Belle of the Boulevard - Dashboard Confessional (3 Themes)\n\n        * Walk Away - Five Finger Death Punch\n\n        * Kiss With a Fist - Florence + the Machine\n\n        * Hella Good - No Doubt (Custom Theme)\n\n        * Bodies (Cahill Remix) - Robbie Williams\n\n        * Tap Tap DomiNation (Morgan Page Remix) - Stroke 9\n\n        * New Moon Rising - Wolfmother\n\n\n-iPenguin/Rasta Monkey.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:520e472e453f070ed670ef3b281c34f31951c6fc","amp;dn":"Cracked+iPhone%2FiPod+Tap+Tap+Revenge+3.1+Sinful%2FxSellize+Edition.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"520e472e453f070ed670ef3b281c34f31951c6fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,14,71,46,69,63,7,14,214,112,239,59,40,28,52,243,25,81,198,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
