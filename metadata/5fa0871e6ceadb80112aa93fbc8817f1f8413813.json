In addition to firearms, you'll also get a chance to take out some aggression on infected with a variety of carnage-creating melee weapons, from chainsaws to axes and even the deadly frying pan.\n\nYou'll be putting these weapons to the test against (or playing as in Versus) three horrific and formidable new Special Infected. You'll also encounter five new ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œuncommonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ common infected, including the terrifying Mudmen.\nHelping to take L4D's frantic, action-packed gameplay to the next level is AI Director 2.0.

Extract the archiv (Password: c@t).\n3. Run Left 4 Dead 2 Setup.exe and install the game.\n4. After installation run the game by using the shorcut on desktop or in startmenu.\n\nMD5 hash sums\nTo verify your downloaded part files you can compare the MD5 checksums with the ones from the original files. This program was used to calculate the sums: http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/hash_my_files.html\n\nFAQ:\nI can't extract your files!?\nVerify your downloaded files by comparing the MD5 hashsums.\n\n\nIs it possible to install Left 4 Dead 2 without using your installer?\nYes, it's possible! Just extract Data.7z of the Left 4 Dead installation. Remember to launch the game with Left 4 Dead 2.exe (not left4dead2.exe!).\n\n\nHow can I host a LAN server?\nRemeber to disable your firewalls!\n\n1. Start Left 4 Dead 2 using the shortcut created on your desktop or startmenu folder.\n2. Type in console (accessable via F3 or at game startup) &quot;map&quot; (without &quot;).\n3. The console already suggest you some map names.\n4. Select one of the map suggestions by clicking on it or scrolling down by using down arrow key.\n5. If you selected a map, just press enter and the LAN server will start immediately.\n\n\nHow can I connect to a LAN server?\nThere are two methods to join a LAN server:\na) You open serverbrowser (F4), chose the LAN tab and select the LAN server.\nb) If you know the LAN server's IP address, type into console (without &quot;): &quot;connect %SERVER_IP%&quot;\n\n\nHow can I change my nick name in game?\nGo to your Left 4 Dead 2 directory and open stryder.ini. At top you will find the entry name= (by default it's name=unnamed). Just change unnamed to your desired nick name.\nYou can also change your name in game by using the console (F3) command (without &quot;): &quot;setinfo name %nick%&quot;. The name set with this command will only last for the game session / game round. After restarting L4D2 / starting a new round your name will be reset to the one in stryder.ini\n\n\nHow can I open the console?\nEither you use the console which is launched at game startup or you can (re)open it by pressing F3.\n\n\nHow can I open the serverbrowser?\nIn game press F4 to open the serverbrowser.\n\n\nHow to connect to a cracked internet server:\nThere are two different ways to connect to a cracked internet server:\n\na) (simple)\nOpen serverbrowser (F4) and select the custom tab. A list of cracked server should be shown.\n\nb) (manual):\nIf you found a cracked server's IP address, type into console (without &quot;): &quot;connect %SERVER_IP%&quot;.\n\n\nHow can I chose my game character?\nYou have to chose your character before hosting / joining a game. After entering the map / connect command enter ; and (without the &quot;): &quot;team_desired &quot;Survivor Ellis&quot; to enter game as Ellis. You can also spawn instead as Rochelle or someone else.\n\n\nCan I use your standalone to host a dedicated internet server?\nNo, it's not possible to launch a dedicated internet server with this release. Instead use these instructions to host it: https://support.steampowered.com/kb_art ... TCMF-2234; and if you want to let cracked clients join your server, use the latest server crack.\n\n\nWhen I connect to a server I receive the error message: &quot;Steam validation rejected&quot;. What's wrong?\nThis error means that the Steam protection on the server is still intact. It seems that the server you're trying to connect to isn't (properly) cracked.\n\n\nWhen I connect to a server I get the error message, that another protocol was exspected or class tables are different. What can I do?\nEither the server or your Left 4 Dead 2 is outdated. Apply the latest update and try again. If updating doesn't help: Try another server or wait for another update.\n\n\nIs it possible to integrate the update into the installation? If so I would have to apply the update after installing (quite handy for LAN)!\nYes, it is possible. There's a special function included in the installer: If there's an Update.7z in the same directory as the installer, this file will be extracted directly after the Left 4 Dead 2 installation. As a consequence the update must be packed as Update.7z and put into the same directory as the installer to let it install the update immediately after installation.\nThis function can also be used to apply custom settings (e. g. implement autoexec.cfg, config.cfg, etc.).\n\n\nHow can I look up which version is installed?\nThere are two version numbers: First version number, which is assigned by me (can be found in Version.txt in Left 4 Dead 2 directory) and second one from developer Valve (in Left 4 Dead 2 directoryleft4dead2steam.inf or use console command version).\n\n\nWhy doesn't the serverbrowser / console open when I press F3 / F4?\nConsole and browser in Left 4 Dead 2 are acting a bit strange: When you are in the main menu of Left 4 Dead 2 (dia chapters at top, generel stuff like options &amp; achievements at the bottom) you have to move the cursor at the lower menu (archievements, options, exit) to be able to open browser and console. Don't ask my why both won't open when the cursor is in upper menu.\n\n\nWhy does my Left 4 Dead 2 crash at startup / when a map is 100% loaded?\nIs there a stryder.ini in your Left 4 Dead 2 directory? If not execute Inigen.exe and enter your prefered nickname. Make sure you run Inigen.exe as administrator (and the game too).\nAnd besides: This is a non Steam release and Steam mustn't run in the background!\n\n\nSpecial thanks and greetings to:\nStryder: For providing his great Loader, which makes this release possible!\n\n\n\nNOTE:\n\nI DO NOT TAKE ANY CREDIT FOR THIS RELEASE\n\n\nALL HAIL CR@CK-iT\n\n\nFOR MORE INFO AND UPDATES GO TO: http://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=32&amp;t=54732","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fa0871e6ceadb80112aa93fbc8817f1f8413813","amp;dn":"Left4Dead_2_CR%40CK-iT_v1.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fa0871e6ceadb80112aa93fbc8817f1f8413813","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,160,135,30,108,234,219,128,17,42,169,63,188,136,23,241,248,65,56,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
