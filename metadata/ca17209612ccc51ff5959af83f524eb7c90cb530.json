Each of the actors did a superb job bringing his or her character to life. The choreography was brilliant, the songs beautiful. I thought the male lead would be disappointing, but he wasn't in the least. This has to be one of the best DCOMs (Disney Channel Original Movies) made yet, if not the best. Watch it! You won't be disappointed! It should be made into a real stage musical. The plot line was engaging. Very much a feel good movie. I appreciated how clean it was, with no swear words or immodest clothing. Most of the time I get sick of watching all the promo stuff on Disney, but not with this movie.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca17209612ccc51ff5959af83f524eb7c90cb530","amp;dn":"High.School.Musical.2006.BRrip.x264.%5BMysteik%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca17209612ccc51ff5959af83f524eb7c90cb530","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,23,32,150,18,204,197,31,245,149,154,248,63,82,78,183,201,12,181,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
