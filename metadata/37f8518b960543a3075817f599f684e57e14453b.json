(Reseed)\nThis release is an updated version of my previously released torrent.\n\nWhat have changed?\n\nWIDESCREEN SUPPORT!\n\n\nJohn RomeoÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s (The Co-creator of Doom), biggest ad most hyped First Person Shooter.\nPersonally i think this game was way ahead of its time, and only got bad reviews for its difficulty.\n\nBut as John Romeo said himself: Daikatana is a Hardcore first person shooter!.\n\n \n\nI have re-coded Daikatana into a Mac Version.\nEverything works as it should :)\n\n\n\nIF YOU GET THE OPENGL ERROR DO THE FOLLOWING:\n\n\n1. Download this Zip (daikatanafix.zip), 3mb.\n\nLINK: http://www.meny-graphics.dk/DaikatanaFix.zip\n\n2. Unpack the Zip.\n3. copy and overwrite the files from DaikatanaFix.zip, into the Folder Daikatana (Rightclick on the Daikatana icon, click Show Package Content.\nNavigate to: Contents -&gt; Resources -&gt; transgaming -&gt; c_drive -&gt; Daikatana)\n\n4. Launch the game! :)\n\n\n\nWidescreen Guide!\n\nThe Default resolution is 1920x1200.\n\nIf you want to change that, you have to do it outside the game.\n\nThe first thing you need to get is an Hex Editor.\nFor mac,  HexFiend is Great.\n\nRightclick on the Daikatana icon, click Show Package Content.\nNavigate to: Contents -&gt; Resources -&gt; transgaming -&gt; c_drive -&gt; Daikatana\nDrag the file &quot;daikatana.exe&quot;, to your desktop.\n\n\n Open HexFiend, and locate the Daikatana.exe file on your desktop. Open it.\n\nStart by pressing &quot;CMD+F&quot;, to find a line.\nWrite:     Mode9: 1920\nAnd press Next.\n\nYou will now see line 739440 (The line numbers are shown to the left in the window)\nThe line above 739440, is line 739424.\nFind number 00800700, and 00B00400 (Usually next to eachother)\n\nThe part &quot;8007&quot;, and &quot;B004&quot;, and the ones that need to be changed.\n\n8007 is the screen width and B004 is the height.\nChange the two numbers (When you press delete, or backspace, it removes 2 digits. Remember that!!!) , into the resolution in the table below:\n\nFor example, if i want to change my resolution to 1280 x 720, \nill change 8007 to 0005, and B004 to D002\n\nAfter you have made your change, save the file, and drag it back into the Daikatana folder. Remember to make a backup of the original Daikatana.exe, if you mess something up.\n\n\nResolutions:\n\n_____________\n1650  x   1050\n90 06    1A 04\n_____________\n1440  x   900\nA0 05     84 03\n\n_____________\n1280   x   720\n00 05     D0 02\n\n\n\n\nENJOY!!!\t\t\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37f8518b960543a3075817f599f684e57e14453b","amp;dn":"%5B++Daikatana+-+for+Mac++%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37f8518b960543a3075817f599f684e57e14453b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,248,81,139,150,5,67,163,7,88,23,245,153,246,132,229,126,20,69,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
