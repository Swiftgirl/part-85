Obviously the older kids were focused on a bit more but even they had something to contribute to the show. There seemed to be a few stereotypes in the town also...the brat, the brain, the idiot, the wise guy, \nThe only show of it's kind and it is fun and interesting to watch! enjoy lcpj","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b483c55b033108de207dc08850f582a8fc32efeb","amp;dn":"Kid+Nation+-+2007+-+All+Except+E06+by+lcpj","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b483c55b033108de207dc08850f582a8fc32efeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,131,197,91,3,49,8,222,32,125,192,136,80,245,130,168,252,50,239,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
