This is the vastly-superior Leathur Records version. This features completely different mixes of the songs, as well as an extra song which was cut, a different track order, and songs with completely different intros and endings. This is an excellent 2nd pressing vinyl rip to CD. Artwork included.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d49be55f66577dd208f03ead3e117431bd6ba000","amp;dn":"Motley+Crue+%281981%29+Too+Fast+For+Love+%28Leathur+Records%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d49be55f66577dd208f03ead3e117431bd6ba000","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,155,229,95,102,87,125,210,8,240,62,173,62,17,116,49,189,107,160,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
