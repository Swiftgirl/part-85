It uses the same DOS gaming engine as the earlier game; however, it had sharper graphics and sound, particularly with the CD-ROM edition. And like its predecessor, the game also features the original cast of the classic Star Trek in a series of new adventures, including one involving Trelane, the omnipotent child from the original episode &quot;The Squire of Gothos&quot;. \n\nThe game also took a step forward from the previous game in the series, in that at least half the missions are part of an ongoing story arc, and one is a direct sequel to the final mission of the previous game. Plus, the Space Battle sequences are now completely optional, with adjustable difficulty.\n\nSee the GalaxyMapJR.png for the map you'll need (look for it in the startmenu). When you first start and you're on the bridge, use the TAB key to get in and out of the view screen.\n\nMD5: 46b1d5950f6e122bbbb7200f87038393\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nUses DOSBox to play.
