Lazing on a Sunday \nAfternoon is a music-hall ditty that owes a debt to the Kinks. '39 \nis a surprisingly poignant folk-rocker written and sung y Brian May. \nYoure My Best Friend is pure 70s AM melodic pop. \nQueen even ventures into vaudeville territory (given Mercurys show-\nbiz leanings, not as much of a stretch as one might think) on the \nfatalistic, old-timey &quot;Good Company.&quot; \n\nThere are several souped-up rockers here as well, but its A NIGHT AT \nTHE OPERAs winning stylistic experimentation that makes it a milestone \nin Queen history.\n\nQueen were straining at the boundaries of hard rock and heavy metal on \nSheer Heart Attack, but they broke down all the barricades on A Night \nat the Opera, a self-consciously ridiculous and overblown hard rock \nmasterpiece. \n\nUsing the multi-layered guitars of its predecessor as a foundation, \nA Night at the Opera encompasses metal, pop. campy British music hall \neventually bringing it all together on the pseudo-operatic Bohemian Rhapsody. \n\nIn short, its a lot like Queens own version of Led Zeppelin IV, but where \nZep find dark menace in bombast, Queen celebrate their own pomposity. \n\nNo one in the band takes anything too seriously, otherwise the arrangements \nwouldn't be as ludicrously exaggerated as they are. But the appeal -- and the\ninfluence -- pf A Night at the Opera is in its detailed, meticulous productions. \n\nIts prog rock with a sense of humor as well as dynamics, and Queen never \nbettered their approach anywhere else.\n__________\n\n 1.
