Demand for food is expected to \n       double within the next 40 years. Yet we can only grow food on four \n       per cent of the earth's surface, the climate is changing and \n       resources like water and fuel are under threat. Jimmy meets the \n       men and women who claim to have new techniques and new \n       technologies that will help meet these challenges.\n       \n       Jimmy visits the USA, the greatest food-producing country on earth. \n       The farmers have put their faith in new technology to increase food \n       output, but is it enough? In search of answers he visits the tomato \n       fields and bioscience labs of California, a high-output pig farm in \n       Iowa, and gets a taste of the Wild West while herding buffalo in \n       South Dakota. Yet it's a farm in North Carolina that offers the \n       most surprising approach of all.\n\n\n                             Big up all scene massive!\n\n\n    \n                                       \n                GROUP  INFORMATION          \n         9 Years of the Force and still    \n                      going strong                  \n     \n\n           What we are looking for:\n\n           * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n           * Fios x264 rippers or cappers\n           * also we have a contest to annouce we are in need of a\n           * new nfo ascii artwork design email us with your designs\n           * winners artwork will be added as our new nfo\n           * dont forget to tag your work\n           * If you think you can help contact us on irc\n           * or email us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;35735a475650755d40465d1b545c&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d71c7ab8466144735c38d9e62898ff2d5b0fd94c","amp;dn":"Jimmys.Global.Harvest.S01E03.720p.HDTV.x264-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d71c7ab8466144735c38d9e62898ff2d5b0fd94c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,28,122,184,70,97,68,115,92,56,217,230,40,152,255,45,91,15,217,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
