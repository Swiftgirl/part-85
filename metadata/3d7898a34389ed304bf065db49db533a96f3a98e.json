The original lyrics of the song Stille Nacht were written in German by the Austrian priest Father Josef Mohr and the melody was composed by the Austrian headmaster Franz Xaver Gruber. In 1859, John Freeman Young published the English translation that is most frequently sung today. The version of the melody that is generally sung today differs slightly (particularly in the final strain) from Gruber's original, which was a sprightly, dance-like tune in 6/8, as opposed to the slow, meditative lullaby version generally sung today. Today, the lyrics and melody are in the public domain.\n\nMannheim Steamroller Christmas Live is Mannheim Steamroller's fourth Christmas album and was first released in 1997. It is a recorded live performance which includes variations on the arranged tracks featured in previous Steamroller albums.\n\nA companion DVD of the concert was also released. The light show consisted of a semi-transparent screen positioned in front of the musicians (as opposed to being in the back like most concerts) where various images would be projected to give a three demensional look.\n\nMannheim Steamroller is a music group founded by Chip Davis, and co-founded by Jackson Berkey, known primarily for its modern recordings of Christmas music. The group has sold 28 million albums in the U.S. alone.\n\nIt was beginning in 1984 that Steamroller found its greatest fame. Davis released his first holiday album, Mannheim Steamroller Christmas, featuring modern contemporary interpretations of Yuletide favorites. This was followed by A Fresh Aire Christmas (1988) and Christmas in the Aire (1995), which showcased creative approaches to old carols, as well as some new carol-like compositions. Steamroller had now become one of the most requested Christmas music artists of all time, in part by adopting a very radio-friendly approach. (In addition, their music was featured around Christmastime by Rush Limbaugh, whose conservative talk radio program was gaining popularity around this time.) By the end of 1997, they had released a live album of Christmas music, Mannheim Steamroller Christmas Live. 2001 saw the release of their fourth all-new Christmas album, Christmas Extraordinaire. Christmas Celebration, a compilation of favorite tracks from the previous studio albums (with one new song), was released in 2004. The studio album Christmas Song was released in late 2007 and features guest vocals by Johnny Mathis and Olivia Newton-John. 2008 saw the release of the CD &quot;Christmasville.&quot; Their newest release is a 25th anniversary Christmas box set consisting of previously released material.\n\nMusically, as the 1990s progressed Davis moved into the mainstream of &quot;New Age&quot; music with a heavier reliance on synthetic instruments and less humor (titles like &quot;Small Wooden Bach'ses&quot; from Fresh Aire III were no more seen, let alone the creative use of a cricket on the same album or the Gregorian chant on Fresh Aire II). His music also began to hew more closely to the &quot;light jazz&quot; style that became prominent in the 1990s, especially with the Day Parts albums.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d7898a34389ed304bf065db49db533a96f3a98e","amp;dn":"Mannheim+Steamroller+-+Silent+Night++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d7898a34389ed304bf065db49db533a96f3a98e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,120,152,163,67,137,237,48,75,240,101,219,73,219,83,58,150,243,169,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
