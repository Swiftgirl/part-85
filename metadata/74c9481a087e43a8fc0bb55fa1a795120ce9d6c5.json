It lands in Washington, DC, on the\n  Mall. The lone occupant steps out and is shot by a jumpy soldier. Gort, a\n  large and very powerful robot appears to save him and is able to melt tanks \n  with the slightest bit of his power. The wounded alien orders Gort to stop \n  his rampage and is taken to a hospital from which he escapes in order to \n  learn more about this planet, even moving in as a boarder with an Earth \n  family. When they begin to suspect him, he reveals himself, along with the\n  news that Gort is a member of a race of super-robot enforcers invented to\n  keep the peace of the galaxy that will destroy the Earth if provoked.\n \n  iMDB .........: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043456/\n  \n           This is a special request, you no who you are! enjoy!\n                                      \n \n  MOViERUSH is a group dedicted to bring you the classics from UK and USA!\n  because most of the releases we do are internal, we try and keep to the best\n  standards possible! we are a group of people who love to watch movies, so we \n  release films that everyone else will enjoy!\n                                      \n \n  We are looking for any of the following:\n \n  100mbit+ affils in europe only!\n  Experienced XviD encoders and audio syncers.\n  If you can supply Pre-Retail DVDs, R5, Silvers or anything else we might need!\n  Work in HMV or Virgin Megastores in UK? contact us!\n \n  EMAiL: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;5b36342d323e292e28331b332e283375383436&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74c9481a087e43a8fc0bb55fa1a795120ce9d6c5","amp;dn":"The.Day.The.Earth.Stood.Still.1951.DVDRip.XviD.iNT-MOViERUSH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74c9481a087e43a8fc0bb55fa1a795120ce9d6c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,201,72,26,8,126,67,168,252,11,181,95,161,167,149,18,12,233,214,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
