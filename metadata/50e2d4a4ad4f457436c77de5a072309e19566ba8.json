However, it would be foolish to overlook &quot;A Christmas To Remember&quot; - an album that never disappoints. A beautiful and ecclectic collection of holiday songs, A Christmas To Remember can satisfy, to steal a line from Nat King Cole, &quot;Kids from one to ninety-two.&quot; From Pamela's magical renditions of &quot;Up On The Housetop&quot; and &quot;Frosty The Snowman&quot; to Max Kim's contributions on &quot;Dancin' In A Winter Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Rock Around The Christmas Tree&quot;, these Christmas recordings truly warm the soul. The Swingin' Organs' whimsical &quot;Christmas Polka&quot; is an instant classic, and Atlanta Rhythm's &quot;Jingle Bell Rock&quot; is a delightful twist on the Bobby Helms classic. For a fitting ending, The Christmas Brass's take on &quot;We Wish You A Merry Christmas&quot; only leaves you wanting more. \n\nThis album is a must-own for anyone who appreciates good holiday music, and the bountiful 25-track songlist makes it a bargain. Our family has this album on constant rotation during the holidays, and I highly recommend that you do the same. \n\n\n[b]Track Listing:[/b]\n\n01 - Atlanta Rhythm - Silver Bells\n02 - Hollywood Strings, The - O Come All Ye Faithful\n03 - Southampton Singers - O Holy Night\n04 - Orion - Joy To The World\n05 - Atlanta Rhythm - Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\n06 - Band, The - Jingle Bells\n07 - Pamela - Frosty the Snowman\n08 - Atlanta Rhythm - Jingle Bell Rock\n09 - Patten, Jay - Silent Night\n10 - Jordanaires, The - O Little Town Of Bethlehem\n11 - Guitar Chimes - Jolly Ol' St. Nicholas\n12 - Hand Bell Choir - I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day\n13 - Christmas Brass - Santa Claus Is Coming To Town\n14 - Patten, Jay - O Christmas Tree\n15 - Hillsboro Singers, The -  Away In a Manger\n16 - Marguerite Piazza - What Child Is This\n17 - Hollywood Strings, The - Ave Maria\n18 - Max Kim - (Dancin' in a) Winter Wonderland\n19 - Swingin Organs - Christmas Polka\n20 - Pamela - Up On The Housetop\n21 - Patten, Jay - God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\n22 - Band, The - Rock Around The Christmas Tree\n23 - Nashville Keyboard Section - We Three Kings\n24 - Marguerite Piazza - The 12 Days of Christmas\n25 - Christmas Brass - We Wish You a Happy Christmas","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50e2d4a4ad4f457436c77de5a072309e19566ba8","amp;dn":"A+Christmas+to+Remember","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50e2d4a4ad4f457436c77de5a072309e19566ba8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,226,212,164,173,79,69,116,54,199,125,229,160,114,48,158,25,86,107,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
