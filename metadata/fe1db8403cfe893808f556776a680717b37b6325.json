I recommend\nskipping to the 4:38 point and beginning there.\nEvidently the audio engineers were on holiday today.\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n\n\n\nThe two hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events.\n\nToday's show, however, consists entirely of previously aired material from multiple earlier broadcasts.\n\n\n\nIn the 1st hour: \n\nan interview with James Delingpole, author and journalist for The Daily Telegraph \n[first aired 27 January 2010]\nand\nan interview with Marc Faber, investment analyst and entrepreneur, who publishes the the monthly investment newsletter The Gloom Boom &amp; Doom Report \n[first aired 26 January 2010].\n\n\nIn the 2nd hour:\n\na conversation with Red Beckman, father of the Fully Informed Jury Association and co-author of The Law That Never Was: The Fraud of the 16th Amendment and Personal Income Tax [first aired 4 February 2010].\n\nAlso in the 2nd hour, though not mentioned in the show description on the Infowars web site, is about four and a half minutes of an interview with Dr. Bruce Levine, , a clinical psychologist in Cincinnati, Ohio. Mr. Levine is the author of Surviving America's Depression Epidemic and Commonsense Rebellion: Taking Back Your Life from Drugs, Shrinks, Corporations, and a World Gone Crazy. Levine provides a compelling alternative approach to treating depression that makes lasting change more likely than with symptom-based treatment through medication. Dr. Levine has been a regular contributor to AlterNet, Z Magazine, and The Huffington Post and his articles and interviews have been published in Adbusters, The Ecologist, High Times and numerous other magazines. He is an editorial advisor for the Icarus Project/Freedom Center Harm Reduction Guide to Coming Off Psychiatric Drugs and on the editorial advisory board of the journal Ethical Human Psychology and Psychiatry.\n[first aired 10 February 2010].\n\n\n\n\nInsofar as I know, Alex will return with live broadcasts tomorrow [Monday, 15 February 2010], but there has been no announcement of which I am aware.\n\n\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
