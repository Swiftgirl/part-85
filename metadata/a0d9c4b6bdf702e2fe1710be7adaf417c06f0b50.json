It was created by Ford Kiernan and Greg Hemphill, who play the lead characters - two Glaswegian pensioners, named Jack Jarvis and Victor McDade respectively.\n\nSince its debut on 1 September 2002, Still Game has shown forty four episodes, including Christmas and Hogmanay specials. The first three series were broadcast only on BBC One Scotland, though five episodes compiled from the first two series were later broadcast throughout the UK on BBC Two in JanuaryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“February 2004. All subsequent episodes have received UK-wide broadcasts on BBC Two. The show has enjoyed higher ratings than its neighbours on the BBC Two Comedy Zone, and received wide critical acclaim. It has also had a radio spin-off, Fags, Mags and Bags, set entirely in a Glasgow corner shop. The future of the show is uncertain as there is no indication of a future series, with Kiernan and Hemphill commenting on wanting some time away from the characters.\n\n\n\nSeries 1 (2002)\n\nFlittin' - Jack's life is increasingly miserable due to anti-social neighbours.
