After a series of events Darren must leave his normal life and go on the road with the Cirque Du Freak and become a Vampire.\n\nRun Time: 109 Minutes\n\nRated PG-13 for sequences of intense supernatural violence and action, disturbing images, thematic elements and some language. \n\n\nI thought the movie was pretty good, I read all the books and the movie was a little disappointing compared to the books but it was overall a good movie, I really hope they make sequel.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77cd4e518c71508709dcd77fc11c92d55272a0c4","amp;dn":"Cirque+Du+Freak%3A+The+Vampires+Assistant+DvD+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77cd4e518c71508709dcd77fc11c92d55272a0c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,205,78,81,140,113,80,135,9,220,215,127,193,28,146,213,82,114,160,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
