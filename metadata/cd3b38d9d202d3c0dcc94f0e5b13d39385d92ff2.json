Crazy World peaked at number 21 on Billboard 200 Chart for albums in 1991. The song &quot;Wind of Change&quot; reached number four on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1991, and &quot;Send Me an Angel&quot; reached number 44 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\nScorpions are a heavy metal/hard rock band from Hanover, Germany, probably best known for their 1980s rock anthem &quot;Rock You Like a Hurricane&quot; and their singles &quot;No One Like You&quot;, &quot;Send Me an Angel, &quot;Still Loving You&quot;, and &quot;Wind of Change&quot;. The band has sold over 100 million albums worldwide, and they were ranked #46 on VH1's Greatest Artists of Hard Rock program. &quot;Rock You Like a Hurricane&quot; is also #18 on VH1's list of the 100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs. After 45 years of performing, the band continues to tour and record music. On January 24, 2010, the band announced that they will be retiring after touring in support of their forthcoming album Sting in the Tail.\n\nOn the Savage Amusement tour in 1988, Scorpions became only the second Western group to play in the Soviet Union (the first being Uriah Heep in December, 1987), with a performance in Leningrad. The following year the band returned to perform at the Moscow Music Peace Festival. As a result, Scorpions developed a strong Russian fan base and still return regularly to perform throughout the area.\n\nWishing to distance themselves from the Savage Amusement style, the band separated from their long-time producer and &quot;Sixth Scorpion,&quot; Dieter Dierks, replacing him with Keith Olsen when they returned to the studio in 1990. Crazy World was released that same year and displayed a less polished sound. The album was a hit, propelled in large part by the massive success of the ballad &quot;Wind of Change&quot;. The song muses on the socio-political changes that were occurring in Eastern Europe and in other parts of the world at the end of the Cold War. On July 21, 1990 they joined many other guests for Roger Waters' massive performance of The Wall in Berlin. Scorpions performed both versions of &quot;In the Flesh&quot; from The Wall. After the Crazy World tour Francis Buchholz, the band's long-serving bassist, left the group.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd3b38d9d202d3c0dcc94f0e5b13d39385d92ff2","amp;dn":"Scorpions+-+Tease+Me+Please+Me++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd3b38d9d202d3c0dcc94f0e5b13d39385d92ff2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,59,56,217,210,2,211,192,220,201,79,14,91,19,211,147,133,217,47,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
