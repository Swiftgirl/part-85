The entire course of the \n\ngame takes place on a mountain in the Himalayas named Chomolonzo, which the natives call &quot;the Sacred One&quot;. The protagonist, Eric \n\nSimmons, is searching for his lost brother, Frank, who was hired by Edward Bennett to retrieve a sacred artifact called a terma. \n\nThe goddess of the mountain became angry, and she bestowed a powerful curse upon Chomolonzo, trapping Frank and everyone who \n\ncould not escape in time. The storyline of the game is heavily influenced by Buddhism and Tibetan folklore.\n\n\nCursed Mountain System Requirements:\n====================================\n \nProcessor : Intel Pentium IV at 3.2 GHz\nVideo Card : 256 MB VRAM ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ nVidia GeForce 6800GT / ATI Radeon X1650 or above with support for Shader Model 3.0\nMemory : 1 GB RAM (2 GB Recommended)\nHard Disk : 8 GB of free Hard Drive Space\nOperating System : Microsoft Windows XP / Windows Vista\nSound Card : DirectX Compatible\nDirect X : 9.0c\nControls : Keyboard &amp; Mouse\n\n\n\n\n               ***** enjoy ... *****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5a33b77060c45f2be871d6ec6768e655989d585","amp;dn":"PC+%C3%82%C2%BB+CURSED+MOUNTAIN+%5BMULTI-4%5D+Full+Game+directplay+by+globe%40","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5a33b77060c45f2be871d6ec6768e655989d585","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,163,59,119,6,12,69,242,190,135,29,110,198,118,142,101,89,137,213,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
