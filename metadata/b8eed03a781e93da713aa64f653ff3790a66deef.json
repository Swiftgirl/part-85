The show ran from 1964-1966 which meant I was 3-5 years old when it aired. I'm amazed how much I remember about this series. In fact, I thought I dreamt the characters up until recently when I saw it re-aired for cable syndication. Indeed, much of my early life was spent fantasizing the life of a forest ranger: reporting forest fires or crimes to the square jawed officer Sergeant Scott(Gordon Pinsent); learning native lessons from Joe Two Rivers(Michael Zenon); listening to tales told in the thick Quebecois accent of Uncle Raoul(Rolland Bedard, they say, but I was sure it was Maurice Chevalier). These three characters, even today, represent the British, Indian and French people who may often fight for separate sovereignty at times but as &quot;The Forest Rangers&quot; shows, these three sub-nations work best when they work together. It is good to see the series picked up by a cable company. I hope the youth of today will enjoy it as much as I did in my youth.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8eed03a781e93da713aa64f653ff3790a66deef","amp;dn":"Forest+Rangers+%281963%29+%28TV%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8eed03a781e93da713aa64f653ff3790a66deef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,238,208,58,120,30,147,218,113,58,166,79,101,63,243,121,10,102,222,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
