Her voice was described as &quot;angelic voice&quot; and &quot;voice of a siren&quot;. This compilation does not include, for some reason, her most famous piece &quot;Concert for One Voice&quot;. I'm planning to post it later. Enjoy!\n\nAll mp3 files in this set are of high quality with 320 kbps sampling rate.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98433d048b6b99456ddad50e0a755669acb13d27","amp;dn":"Danielle+Licari+-+The+Greatest+Hits","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98433d048b6b99456ddad50e0a755669acb13d27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,67,61,4,139,107,153,69,109,218,213,14,10,117,86,105,172,177,61,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
