It comes from the the National Center for Education Statistics, and the Census.\n\nUnfortunately, it's also wrong. Or at least very misleading, since it ignores major sources of spending. As CATO Education scholar Andrew Coulson explains:\n\nDC also has a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œstateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ level bureaucracy that spends nearly $200 million annually on k-12 programs, and the city spends another $275 million or so on school construction, school facilities modernization, and other so-called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcapitalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ projects.\n\nBut those aren't included in the regular spending figures.\n\nThe $15,000 statistic is also misleading because it includes money for kids in charter schools, even though those schools are not guaranteed a student base and so are forced to be much more efficient than regular public schools.\n\nThe real figure? $26,000 for each student signed up at a DC public school. $28,000 for each student who actually attended. Some might say that's an unfair number because it includes special education students that the private schools supposedly won't take. But even if you drop the costs of special education students, DC still spends $23,000 per kid.\n\nYou know public education is a mess when hardly anyone can keep track of what schools really spend. As Coulson tells me:\n\nSchool district budgets are so convoluted itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s almost as if theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re made to be confusing... DC has split up its education spending into seven different budgets, all of which go to k-12 public education, but only one of which is called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe DC Public School budget.\n\nOh, and the $7,500 for voucher schools? Turns out that the average voucher school only charges $6,620 (many are catholic schools.) So they cost a quarter of what public schools do, but still they do better!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c48f2ec86695f2a587dc3835df5acf8b0e2a56f","amp;dn":"20100218-Stossel-%5BGovernment+Schools%5D.Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c48f2ec86695f2a587dc3835df5acf8b0e2a56f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,72,242,236,134,105,95,42,88,125,195,131,93,245,172,248,176,226,165,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
