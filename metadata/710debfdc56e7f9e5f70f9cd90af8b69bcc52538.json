Local programming thrives as TV stations create         \n    shows for their viewing public. Suddenly the &quot;horror host&quot; becomes a     \n    nationwide presence on the airwaves as old horror and sci-fi movies      \n    are released to television. Dr. Dreck and Moaner go on the air in the    \n    small town of Fibbia, Mass. They incur the wrath of the station's        \n    grand dame, Louise Morgan, when the popularity of their show pushes      \n    her show off the air. So Louise gets nasty. But Dr. Dreck and Moaner     \n    can get nastier. Because they are what they really seem to be; a mad     \n    scientist and a zombie!                                                  \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?
