It's funny, but you can go around knowing songs and stuff, yet never know who really wrote them.. Well, Rich Mullins was one of those to me. Until Doc found me wanting.. Thanks again, buddy.\n\nThis is the real stuff. No plastic Jesus in here.\n\nRichard Wayne Mullins (October 21, 1955 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ September 19, 1997) was an American Christian music singer and songwriter born in Richmond, Indiana. He was killed in a jeep accident in September 1997.\n\nThis recording is a &quot;Remembering Rich Mullins&quot; - Radioshow, and was at a time available on CD from the station itself. Now it's only available as streamed audio from the station's website, and doesn't have the quality that this torrent have. I've combined the two CDs into one folder and tagged and put in a little coverart and stuff..\n\nNow I must turn to [amongst other] Wikipedia to give you some info:\n\nMullins is best known for his worship songs &quot;Step by Step&quot; (later incorporated into his hit single &quot;Sometimes by Step&quot;) and &quot;Awesome God&quot;, both of which have been embraced as modern classics by many Christians. Some of his albums are also considered among Christian music's best, including &quot;Winds of Heaven, Stuff of Earth&quot; (1988), &quot;The World As Best As I Remember It, Volume One&quot; (1991) and &quot;A Liturgy, A Legacy, &amp; A Ragamuffin Band&quot; (1993). [Recommended strongly. V]\n\nRich Mullins is also remembered for his devotion to the Christian faith, which was often an inspiration to others.\n\nHere's a quote by Mullins from another place:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNever forget what Jesus did for you. Never take lightly what it cost Him. And never assume that if it cost Him His very life, that it wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t also cost you yours.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nHis faith can be understood by a quote he gave at a concert shortly before his death. He stated that:\n\n&quot;Jesus said whatever you do to the least of these my brothers youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve done it to me.\nAnd this is what IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve come to think: That if I want to identify fully with Jesus Christ, who I claim to be my Savior and Lord, the best way that I can do that is to identify with the poor.\n\nThis I know will go against the teachings of all the popular evangelical preachers. But theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re just wrong. TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re not bad, theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re just wrong.\n\nChristianity is not about building an absolutely secure little niche in the world where you can live with your perfect little wife and your perfect little children in a beautiful little house where you have no gays or minority groups anywhere near you.\n\nChristianity is about learning to love like Jesus loved and Jesus loved the poor and Jesus loved the broken....&quot;(concert recording cuts off at this moment, losing any further context for this particular quote)\n\nWell, do you think it's worth the download?\n\nLove from Verifire.\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;83f5e6f1eae5eaf1e6eee2eaefc3e4eee2eaefade0ecee&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&quot;Personally I've found the hope of deliverance and enlightenment through Yeshua Ha'Mashiach to be the greatest mystery and riddle, shrouded in the shadows of shame, but revealed to those who seek the Truth, no matter the cost.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d5050986d544e846a36f812e4102f56adb75b4d","amp;dn":"Rich+Mullins+-+Radio+Memorial+Tribute+%5Bmp3%40Vbr%7E320%5D%5BVerifire%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d5050986d544e846a36f812e4102f56adb75b4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,80,80,152,109,84,78,132,106,54,248,18,228,16,47,86,173,183,91,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
