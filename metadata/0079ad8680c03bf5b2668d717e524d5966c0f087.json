It was Rand's fourth, longest and last novel, and she considered it her magnum opus in the realm of fiction writing.[1] As indicated by its working title The Strike, the book explores a dystopian United States where leading innovators, ranging from industrialists to artists, refuse to be exploited by society. The protagonist, Dagny Taggart, sees society collapse around her as the government increasingly asserts control over all industry, while society's most productive citizens, led by the mysterious John Galt, progressively disappear. Galt describes the strike as &quot;stopping the motor of the world&quot; by withdrawing the &quot;minds&quot; that drive society's growth and productivity; with their strike these creative minds hope to demonstrate that the economy and society would collapse without the profit motive and the efforts of the rational and productive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0079ad8680c03bf5b2668d717e524d5966c0f087","amp;dn":"Atlas+rus-eng+part+2+180110.doc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0079ad8680c03bf5b2668d717e524d5966c0f087","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,121,173,134,128,192,59,245,178,102,141,113,126,82,77,89,102,192,240,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
