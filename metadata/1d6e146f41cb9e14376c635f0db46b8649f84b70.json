Art Wood had been a vocalist with Alexis Korner's\nBlues Incorporated for a short period during 1962, simultaneously\nfronting his own group, the Art Wood Combo.\n\nWhen keyboardist Jon Lord and guitarist Derek Griffiths from Red\nBludd's Bluesicians joined the Art Wood Combo, they re-christened\nthemselves the Artwoods. Keef Hartley, formerly with Rory Storm &amp; The\nHurricanes, joined on drums in December 1964 and the band turned\nprofessional, securing a residency at London's 100 Club and signing a\nrecording contract with Decca Records.\n\nBand Members:\n\nArt Wood - Lead Vocals;\nDerek Griffiths - Lead Guitar;\nJon Lord - Keyboards;\nMalcolm Pool - Bass Guitar;\nKeef Hartley - Drums.\n\nAlbum Tracks:\n\n01.
