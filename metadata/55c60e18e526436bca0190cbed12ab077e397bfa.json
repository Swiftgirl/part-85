This is what I use.\nVLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.\nOne can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.\nQuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.\nMany of movies I encode have embedded subtitles. So far, only VLC player is able to use them correctly.\n\nModerators, please, do not move this torrent in &quot;Handhelds&quot; category.\nIT'S NOT STRICTLY HANDHELD-COMPATIBLE FILE, SUBTITLES ARE MUXED-IN.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55c60e18e526436bca0190cbed12ab077e397bfa","amp;dn":"Deadline.2009.BluRay.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55c60e18e526436bca0190cbed12ab077e397bfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,198,14,24,229,38,67,107,202,1,144,203,237,18,171,7,126,57,123,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
