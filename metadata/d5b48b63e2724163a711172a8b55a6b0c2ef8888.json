He  \n           involves  his wife as the fictional co-respondent for  \n           painter  Carlo Stasio  but  the pair are shot dead in  \n           the  hotel  room.  In charge  of the  case  is Frank,  \n           Tony's  ex-partner still  on the Brighton force.  His  \n           most likely suspects  are Angeline, Stasio's mistress  \n           who  is set  to inherit  his house and pictures,  and  \n           Tony  himself,  parts  of  whose  story don't seem to  \n           add up.                                                \n                                                                  \n                                                                  \n          SUBS                                                    \n           Czech, Slovak                                          \n                                                                  \n                                                                  \n                                                                  \n          GREETS                                                  \n                     ANT - SDTV - DvF - FFM - iLLUSiON            \n                    KiNOBOX - NEPTUNE - PARTiCLE - PiVO           \n                          TDF - TURKiSO - XviK                    \n                                                                  \n                                                                  \n                                                                  \n                                                                  \n                                                                  \n                                           \n              NEWS               \n                                                       \n                                              \n           Looking for 1 EU and 1 CZ/SK        \n                    affil site.                  \n                                                       \n                                                   \n                                                         \n                                                        \n                                                    \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                           \n                                                        \n                                                 \n                             \n                                    \n                            \n                              \n                                \n                                     \n                                      \n                                                \n                                 \n                             \n                                \n                              \n                          \n                                      \n                                 \n                             \n                                 \n                           \n                      \n                           \n                          \n                          \n                                 \n                               \n                           \n                                  \n                                         \n                                            \n\n   Here we come at TiDE time, to give you another pearl . . .\n\n                                      . . . from our secret treasure island.\n\n\n                                 - 131007 -","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5b48b63e2724163a711172a8b55a6b0c2ef8888","amp;dn":"Under.Suspicion.1991.DVDRip.XviD.iNTERNAL-TiDE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5b48b63e2724163a711172a8b55a6b0c2ef8888","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,180,139,99,226,114,65,99,167,17,23,42,139,85,166,176,194,239,136,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
