Laura Flanders joins us tonight to discuss the news of the weird, and it was plenty this week.

Many thanks to those of you who have donated subscriptions to support this show and allow other to hear it.\n\nListen and call to play: 877-996-2556!\n\nThe CPAC fruitcakes got lucky today with the mediaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s obsession with Tiger WoodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sex obsession, it knocked coverage of their kooky convention right off the A-block of the news cycle.  But we havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t forgotten those flying monkey freaks!
