In the series, E. Blackadder Esquire is the butler to the Prince of Wales (the prince is played by Hugh Laurie as a complete fop and idiot). Despite Edmund's respected intelligence and abilities, he has no personal fortune to speak of, apart from his frequently fluctuating wage packet from the Prince, as he says: 'If I'm running short of cash all I have to do is go upstairs and ask Prince Fat-head for a raise'.\n\nSeason/series 3: 6 episodes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47570d83ef766c45fb420a29fcf5708363f86e45","amp;dn":"Blackadder+the+Third+%28Third+series%2C+1987%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47570d83ef766c45fb420a29fcf5708363f86e45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,87,13,131,239,118,108,69,251,66,10,41,252,245,112,131,99,248,110,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
