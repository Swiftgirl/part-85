The album was the first of their albums to feature guitarist Adrian Smith, and the last to feature vocalist Paul Di'Anno, who was fired from the band mid-tour due to problems with alcohol and cocaine. This was also the first album produced by veteran producer Martin Birch who went on to produce their next eight albums before retiring after Fear of the Dark in 1992.\n\nBeing the most popular song on the album, &quot;Wrathchild&quot; has been on the set lists of nearly all of the band's concert tours. The song was covered in 2005 by the female tribute The Iron Maidens on their 2007 album Route 666 and again in 2008 by Gallows on the tribute CD Maiden Heaven: A Tribute to Iron Maiden released by Kerrang! magazine.[1]\n\nThe song was also featured in the PlayStation 2 game Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s.\n\nKillers \n\n01 The Ides Of March\n02 Wrathchild (Harris)\n03 Murders In The Rue Morgue\n04 Another Life\n05 Genghis Khan\n06 Innocent Exile\n07 Killers\n08 Prodigal Son\n09 Purgatory\n10 Twilight Zone\n11 Drifter\n\nSpecial Multimedia Section:\n01 Wratchild (taken from Live At The Rainbow)\n02 Killers (taken from Live At The Rainbow)\n\nIncluye todas las carÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡tulas.\n\nFormato: ImÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡gen MDF (grabar con Alcohol 120%)\nTamaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±o: 610 mb \n\nRequerimientos:\nPC: Windows 95 - 486/66 Processor - 2 Speed CD-ROM Drive - 100% Multisession compatible - Monitor that supports 16 bit colour at 800x600 - 16 bit soundcard - QuickTime for Windows (supplied)\nMacintosh: PowerPC or Performa running MacOS 7.x - 5 Mb free RAM - 2 Speed CD-ROM Drive - 100% Multisession compatible - Monitor that supports 16 bit colour at 800x600 - 16 bit soundcard - QuickTime for Macintosh (supplied)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a61f0b551dc52a9f1385c2863f73d86ae4325aed","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-++Killers%28+mdf+-+mds+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a61f0b551dc52a9f1385c2863f73d86ae4325aed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,31,11,85,29,197,42,159,19,133,194,134,63,115,216,106,228,50,90,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
