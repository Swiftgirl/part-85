Yes that is unfortunately true.\n However there is no other English language scene grp preing as many Olympic releases \n as we are from any source. It is not 2HDs fault that NBC can't broadcast the full\n events and we can only work with what we are given. It's a lot of extra work to do these\n pres for you guys and the bitching about them being &quot;highlight reels&quot; is getting to us.\n\n So if there were other options out there, we'd gladly step aside but people seem \n to want these events so we're doing the best we can under the circumstances.\n\n As for the delays on some events, we have jobs too and can't be encoding 24/7\n\n            Think you have what it takes to be a part of 2X?\n                          &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;3b5f54485e4a4e52487b5849424b4f54565a52571554495c&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n\n                            \n                                                          \n                                                   \n                                                  \n                                                  \n                                         \n                                                   \n                          \n                                       \n                                                   \n                                     \n                             \n                         \n                  \n               RESPECT TO        \n        \n       \n       \n         FQM       \n   \n        \n                  2x    \n                        SunZero 2oo6","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:644e3c90a9c602764450d4beca76b4485930f194","amp;dn":"2010.Vancouver.Olympics.Womens.Super.Combined.Alpine.Skiing.HDTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"644e3c90a9c602764450d4beca76b4485930f194","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,78,60,144,169,198,2,118,68,80,212,190,202,118,180,72,89,48,241,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
