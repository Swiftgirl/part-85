It offers the stability and security that only a BSD-based operating system can bring, while at the same time providing a comfortable user experience, allowing you to get the most out of your computing time. With PC-BSD you can spend less time working to fix viruses or spyware  #   and instead have the computer work for you.\nInstalling the system is simply a matter of a few clicks and a few minutes for the installation process to finish. Hardware  #   such as video, sound, network and other devices will be auto-detected and available at the first system startup. Home  #   users will immediately feel comfortable with PC-BSD's desktop interface  #  , with KDE 4.x running under the hood  #  . Software installation  #   has also been designed to be as painless as possible, simply double-click and software  #   will be installed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c802d373de62f38f95249c6a60acc0378cae718","amp;dn":"PC+-+BSD+7.1+x86","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c802d373de62f38f95249c6a60acc0378cae718","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,128,45,55,61,230,47,56,249,82,73,198,166,10,204,3,120,202,231,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
