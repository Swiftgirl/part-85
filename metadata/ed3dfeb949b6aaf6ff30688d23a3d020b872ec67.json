If not this game, then at least SOMETHING by Capcom. Thanks.\nThis is my first torrent by the way.\nPLEASE SEED AS MUCH AS YOU DOWNLOAD!!!\nThe trackers included with this torrent is a collection that I have accumulated. Please feel free to copy and paste them into every torrent you download, as that will increase your chances of getting more seeds/peers, therefore increasing your download speed. ENJOY!!!\n===================================================================================\nDirectly from the retail box:\n\nDevil May Cry 4\n---------------\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nOS: Windows XP/Vista/7\nCPU: Intel Pentium 4 or higher\nRAM: 512MB for XP/ 1GB for Vista/7\nVideo:  VRAM 256MB or higher; GeForce 6600 or higher\n\nIncreased performance will be noticed on more powerful systems.\n\n===================================================================\n===================================================================\nNow what I have to say about it. F**K what the box's system requirements tell you.\nIn my honest opinion, this game would be COMPLETELY unplayayble on this type of\nsystem. I would recommend AT LEAST:\nOS: Vista/7\nCPU: Dual-Core, 2GHz\nRAM: 2GB DDR-2\nVideo: GeForce 8400 (NOT PCI, PCI-E highly recommended!!!!!!)\nSound: Creative Labs X-Fi\nController: Either a Playstation 2-type gamepad or XBOX 360 controller for PC. Though it is possible to play this with the mouse and keyboard, I highly recommend spending $25 for a decent gamepad.\n======================================================================================================================================\n======================================================================================================================================\n\nFor those of you wondering if a crack or serial or keygen or any of that is required, not at all.\nHowever, you DO need to have the disc in to play, so I would suggest either using Daemon Tools to\nmount it or burning this .iso onto a dual-layer DVD.\n======================================================================================================================================\n======================================================================================================================================\n\nI have included a 100% save file.\n\nIt goes into the following directory after you install the game:\n\nC:UsersYOUR ACCOUNT NAME HEREDocumentsCAPCOMDEVILMAYCRY4\n\nUpon a fresh installation, there should be no files there.\n\nI DID NOT CREATE THIS SAVE FILE. I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO OWNERSHIP OF THIS FILE. IT WAS GIVEN TO ME\nBY A FRIEND, WHO ALSO DID NOT CREATE THIS FILE. HE DOWNLOADED IT FROM GAMESPOT I THINK, SO WHOEVER\nSPENT THE TIME AND PUT FORTH THE AMAZING EFFORT TO UNLOCK EVERYTHING IN THIS GAME, MAD MAD PROPS!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed3dfeb949b6aaf6ff30688d23a3d020b872ec67","amp;dn":"Devil+May+Cry+4+%2B+100+Save+File","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed3dfeb949b6aaf6ff30688d23a3d020b872ec67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,61,254,185,73,182,170,246,255,48,104,141,35,163,208,32,184,114,236,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
