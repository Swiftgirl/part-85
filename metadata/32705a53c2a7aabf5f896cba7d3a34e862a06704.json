Like Fleetwood Mac, Free came together with a little help from those twin founders of the British blues boom--John Mayall\nand Alexis Korner--and like Led Zeppelin, they hit lucky--and big--early on.\nA chance meeting between singer Paul Rodgers and guitarist Paul Kossoff prompted the formation of Free; and early in 1970, barely a year\nafter the release of their debut album, Free went straight to No.2 with the unforgettable &quot;All Right Now&quot;. It may have been derivative\n(listen to the Stones' &quot;Honky Tonk Women&quot;), but the song has remained a rock &amp; roll staple ever since--it is estimated that, even now,\n&quot;All Right Now&quot; is played somewhere in the world every 45 seconds.\n\nOver the years, while Led Zeppelin attained mythic stature, Free have continued to be regarded as a second division blues band.\nBut the history of Free was more troubled--starting in 1976 with Kossoff's premature death, from a heart attack, following his split\nfrom the band. And, of course, everything Free did subsequently was overshadowed by &quot;All Right Now&quot;.\n\nSongs Of Yesterday proves the point that there was always much more to Free than just one freak hit. Crammed full of previously unreleased\nstudio tracks, mouth-watering demos, out-takes and other rarities, Songs Of Yesterday does the business and does it thoroughly.\nAmong the gems are the first attempt at &quot;All Right Now&quot;; a loose-limbed alternate take of &quot;Makin' Love&quot;; and previously unavailable versions\nof familiar titles like &quot;My Brother Jake&quot;, &quot;Little Bit Of Love&quot; and &quot;Wishing Well&quot;. There is also an entire disc of hitherto unavailable\nlive material from 1970, full of concert atmosphere. And, don't forget, Free also had a softer side, as &quot;Love You So&quot; and &quot;Soon I Will Be Gone&quot;\ndemonstrate.\n\nIt is a triumphant achievement: a box set that actually makes you appreciate a band afresh. Free may never have attained the greatness of\neither the Stones or Led Zeppelin, but they had great potential, and Songs Of Yesterday displays it to the full.\n\n\nTrack List\n\nDisc: 1\n\n1.
