Their first album showed that they were firmly rooted in the early 70's progressive style of YES, PINK FLOYD and fellow German rockers, ELOY. This album were Symphonic rock at its best, with mellotron, lots of keyboards and a beautiful female voice. &quot;Earthly Paradise&quot; is a classic prog album, serving a mellifluous mÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lange of melodic Mellotron and Moog.\n\nA second album, &quot;Endangered&quot;, featuring songs from 1978 rerecorded in the nineties, was released in October/November 1994. The first three songs are great, the rest almost drifts away to pop regions. This album, although carrying on in a similar vein to the debut, wasn't particularly well received either and the band split in 1995.\n\nHenne, GÃƒâ€˜Ã…â€™nther (organ, mellotron, mini moog, piano)\nKunert, Heinz (bass, percussion)\nLinke, Gerd (organ, mellotron, mini moog, clavinet, pianos)\nOehmig, Volker (drums, percussion)\nStruck, Manfred (drums, percussion)\nWand, Christine (vocals)\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
