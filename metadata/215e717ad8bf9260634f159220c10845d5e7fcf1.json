Luke's Star Wars cohorts Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) are likewise more experienced in the ways and means of battling the insidious Empire, as represented by the brooding Darth Vader (body of David Prowse, voice of James Earl Jones). And, of course, &quot;The Force,&quot; personified by the ghost of Luke's mentor Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness), is with them all. Retreating from Vader's minions, Luke ends up, at first, on the Ice Planet Hoth, and then the tropical Dagobah. Here he makes the acquaintance of the gnomish Yoda (voice of Frank Oz), whose all-encompassing wisdom comes in handy during the serial-like perils of the rest of the film. Before the film's open-ended climax, we are introduced to the apparently duplicitous Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) and are let in on a secret that profoundly affects both Luke and his arch-enemy, Vader. Many viewers consider this award-winning film the best of the Star Wars movies, and its special-effects bonanza was pure gold at the box office.\n\n                            \n\n\n\t\t\t\tM P A A  R A T I N G  * * * \n\n\t                                 Rated PG\n\n\n\n\t\t\t       R E L E A S E   D A T E  * * *\n\n\t\t\t\t\t21 May 1980\n\n\n                           \n\n\t\t\t\tD V D  C o n t e n t  * * * \n  \n        Main Movie ******:\n         * Video - UNTOUCHED - 2957 Kbps Fullscreen\n         * Audio - English, Spanish, French\n         * Subs  - English\n\n        Menu ************:\n         * Yes\n\n        Extras **********:\n         * All\n\n        Ripped **********:\n         * Nothing\n\n\n        Chapters ********:\n\n1.
