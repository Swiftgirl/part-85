PumaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s approach is tasteful, gentle and unpretentious, and his finely-etched, sensitive guitar playing garnered the respect of his fellow musicians and such critical acclaim as the 1957 New Star award for his instrument in the poll conducted by Metronome magazine.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25b4ee7759f069c740f02e33688e4dba6e83ba07","amp;dn":"The+Jazz+Guitar+Of+Joe+Puma+%281954-1957%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25b4ee7759f069c740f02e33688e4dba6e83ba07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,180,238,119,89,240,105,199,64,240,46,51,104,142,77,186,110,131,186,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
