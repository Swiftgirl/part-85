Old wooden houses are demolished to give way to large residential complexes and gigantic food festivals. French acrobats dominate cultural life and behind it all, the global financial crisis is looming. In the middle of this materialistic everyday reality is Jonny Kristiansen, an up-and-coming 25 year old broker. Hungry for money and success, he is pulled into an unscrupulous financial world with cigars, champagne and exclusive escort girls. Jonny takes off and aims at the top of the finance pyramid with his goal to become the best, richest and most powerful at whatever cost.\n\n.SOURCE........[ DVD9 R2 PAL\n.VIDEO.........[ 640x272 @ 909kbps\n.AUDIO.........[ NORWEGIAN 124kb/s VBR MP3\n.SUBS..........[ ENG, DK, NO, SE, FI\n\ncredit MoA &amp; to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone\n\n*****help what we can with haiti...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97dce605488717c7df2d99842ed3993e5c8cf1fd","amp;dn":"Rottenetter.2009.DVDRip.XviD-MoA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97dce605488717c7df2d99842ed3993e5c8cf1fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,220,230,5,72,135,23,199,223,45,153,132,46,211,153,62,92,140,241,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
