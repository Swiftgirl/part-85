As they drive away the Orks they are confronted by Mek Badzappa and his wartrukk. Although the Mek escapes, the Marines collapse the mine through which they are coming and take a victory. After this they strike from the cruiser Armageddon into a hamlet where Scout Sergeant Cyrus is waiting for them. They manage to fight their way to the defender of the hamlet, Sergeant Avitus, rescue him and save the hamlet from Orks.\n\nAfter this they receive word that Orks have attacked two more key locations and assume someone is leading them. The first attack is led by a Stormboyz Nob named Skykilla and the second by Warboss Gutrencha. After this the Marines obtain information from Skykilla and Gutrencha and find that both have visited Felhammer Mine recently. They also learn that Mek Badzappa is there as well. However Cyrus remains onboard the Armageddon to provide technical support. When they enter the mine they see a Warp Spider Exarch and his retinue vanish, and the marines are rescued from Ork gunners by Sergeant Thaddeus. They also find Badzappa and his platoon under attack by an Eldar Warlock and a company of Guardians. Although they kill the Warlock, the Mek escapes once again. As the Warlock dies he speaks of a greater foe threatening them all but the heroes remain unconcerned.\n\nThey travel to planet Typhon to stop Eldar activity. A Warp Spider Exarch is stirring up the Orks into revolt and must be eliminated. He mentions nothing of the so-called &quot;greater foe&quot; but Thule asks them to return to Calderis as Mek Badzappa is launching an attack against the capital, and citizens are reporting plants mutating and small purple creatures killing livestock. The Space Marines arrive and finally kill the Mek, but they are soon attacked by the Tyranids. Thule is mortally wounded by a Tyranid Warrior and Techmarine Martellus leads them back to safety after they destroy the Tyranid attack force.\n\nThe Space Marines return to Typhon, leaving Apothecary Gordian in charge of Thule. They kill the Eldar ranger Nemerian, who has been stirring up trouble and returning to Calderis to kill the Tyranid Warrior that mortally wounded Captain Thule.\n\nAfter this the game presents three primary objectives to complete: gathering a sample of bio-toxin, securing the Astronomic Array, and defending Angel Forge. These can be completed in any order desired. The Astronomic array will grant the player orbital bombardment and deep-strike, defending Angel Forge will allow Sergeant Tarkus to use Terminator Armour, and the bio-toxin will provides a Dreadnought which is the revived Captain Davian Thule.\n\nUpon completion of all three objectives, the Tyranid poison is ready for delivery. However, the Litany of Fury (which has been traveling to the player's aid for some time) is psionically assaulted by the Hive Mind and is in grave danger of becoming lost in the Warp. This effectively takes your reinforcements out of the picture - but the Hive Mind is weakened from the exertion and goes to planet Typhon to feed. The player's strike team deploys on the planet and administers the poison to the Hive Mind through its feeder tendrils. In the space battle above, the Armageddon is destroyed and Gordian killed.\n\nAs the poison takes effect, all appears lost as the strike team has no means of retreat and massive waves of Tyranids are preparing to attack them. Suddenly, Gabriel Angelos and an entire company of Blood Ravens land on the battlefield and protect your force from the oncoming Tyranids. Angelos himself joins your command and is completely controllable; with his help your team kills the Hive Tyrant Alpha and the day is won.\n\n\n\nMinimum System Requirements:\n============================\n\nOS: Windows XP/Vista\nProcessor: Pentium 4 @ 3.2 GHz or any Dual Core Processor\nMemory: 1 GB for XP, 1.5 GB for Vista\nHard Drive: 5.5 GB Free\nVideo Memory: 128 MB (nVidia GeForce 6600 GT/ATI X1600 (Shader Model 3.0)\nSound Card: DirectX Compatible\nDirectX: 9.0c or 10\nKeyboard &amp; Mouse\nDVD Rom Drive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              ***** enjoy ... *****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33ea87b3db818621460fb4b4a92e93faa09dfdb7","amp;dn":"PC+%C3%82%C2%BB+WARHAMMER+40000+-+DAWN+OF+WAR+2+v1.1.3+Full+Game+directpla","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33ea87b3db818621460fb4b4a92e93faa09dfdb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,234,135,179,219,129,134,33,70,15,180,180,169,46,147,250,160,157,253,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
