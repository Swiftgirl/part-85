four feature length films. The series  throws\n        Chief Inspector Gently into a maelstrom of murders and mayhem,\n        whilst lovingly recreating the swinging sixties as it  finally\n        hits the North-East, in perfect and nostalgic detail.\n\n        Chief Inspector George  Gently is the  classic unsung hero  of\n        detective fiction and in Martin Shaws expert hands he becomes\n        a passionate, growling, ex-army boxer. With his sidekick,  the\n        ambitious and undisciplined  Detective Sergeant John  Bacchus,\n        they make the perfect  police partnership, full of  warmth and\n        humour. But even the closest  partners can come to blows  when\n        Gently and Bacchus enter the boxing ring, to raise monies  for\n        the police widows fund  but who will be knocked out for  the\n        count of ten?\n\n     \n                                           \n                EPISODE SUMMARY                  \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n        Season 2, Episode 1: Gently with the Innocents\n\n        Gently and Bacchus  investigate when elderly  Alfred Peachment\n        is found murdered in the  grounds of the large house  where he\n        lived alone, formerly a children's home which he superintended\n        but now closed  for several years.  The house was  being sold,\n        against his wishes, by a  committee headed by his ex-wife  and\n        her  brother,  the  local  doctor,  to  the  seemingly callous\n        property  developer  Cora  Davidson.  Harry,  Alfred's   mute,\n        simple-minded gardener,  is the  chief suspect  and he attacks\n        Bacchus.  Only overly  helpful local  copper Blacksmith  seems\n        able to communicate  with the boy,  causing Bacchus to  resent\n        him. A discussion  with an old  flame leads Gently  to suspect\n        that Peachment may have been a paedophile, abusing children in\n        his care, and that any of the suspects may be acting alone  or\n        as a group of avengers, to punish him for past misdeeds.\n\n     \n                                           \n                   RIP NOTES                     \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n                                    Enjoy!\n\n     \n                                           \n               GROUP INFORMATION                 \n        9 Years of the Force and still         \n                     going strong                      \n     \n\n        What we are looking for:\n\n        * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n        * Fios x264 rippers or cappers\n        * Internal 100mbit 1tb+ dump sites for Exlusive group usage\n\n        * Also we have a contest to annouce we are in need of a\n        * new nfo ascii artwork design email us with your designs.\n        * Winners artwork will be added as our new nfo\n        * dont forget to tag your work\n\n        * If you think you can help contact us on irc,\n        * or email us on &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;0f49607d6c6a4f677a7c67216e66&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9af42dc3657435b299438164f389bb3c9f18166","amp;dn":"George.Gently.S02E01.DVDRip.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9af42dc3657435b299438164f389bb3c9f18166","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,175,66,220,54,87,67,91,41,148,56,22,79,56,155,179,201,241,129,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
