Indeed, a not-so-small industry has arisen around the date, hawking everything from t-shirts to teleseminars.\n\nClearing a path between fantasy and reality, Alexandra Bruce surveys the entire 2012 landscape, asking questions such as:\n\n    * Is the Earth losing its Mojo?\n    * How did 2012 come to mean &quot;The End of Time&quot;?\n    * Did psychedelics facilitate the Maya &quot;Cosmovision&quot;?\n    * Should we worry about Earth Crustal Displacement?\n    * What the hell is &quot;Planet X&quot;?\n\nUniquely amongst a vast array of 2012 literature, this book features interviews with the leading expertsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½including Graham Hancock, John Major Jenkins, Daniel Pinchbeck and many othersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and insightful, detailed analysis of the broad spectrum of opinion, debate, research and myth regarding the most compelling &quot;end times&quot; prediction of the 21st century.\nAbout the Author\nAlexandra Bruce's articles on urban legends, metaphysical and quantum physics themes have been published in Paranoia Magazine, Steamshovel Press, Borderland Sciences and Disinfo.com.
