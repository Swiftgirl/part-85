And there's an amazing story      \n         behind every one. Any idea how they get the sesame seeds to   \n         stick to the bun? What does it take to stuff 20 tomatoes      \n         inside a ketchup bottle? And what's the secret to getting     \n         the dill in dill pickle chips? Host Bobby Bognar sets         \n         off on a quest to find out, as he travels the country to      \n         unearth the hidden mysteries inside our cheeseburger and      \n         fries. It's the science behind perfectly melting cheese,      \n         the production of jet-black seeds that sprout into Spanish    \n         onions, and a French Fry factory where every day mountains    \n         of potatoes are sliced and diced in to 36 million French      \n          fries.                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n         Release  Notes    \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n         I CAN HAS CHEEZBURGER?                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n          Group Greets     \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                           CTU, ORENJi, 2HD, DHD                       \n                                                                        \n            and all other groups that choose quality over speed         \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n        \n       Contact Info      \n                                      \n                                        \n                                                                  \n       We are currently looking for:                                  \n                                                                       \n           * US/CA cappers with HDTV and/or DSR feed - min 60 kB/s      \n                                                                        \n         GROUP NEWS: No, we will not affil your brand new/DR/colo site, \n                     so please don't ask.
