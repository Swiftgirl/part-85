Besides playing the usual venues they challenged themselves and played in buses, cafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s and for Indian tribal elders. Music video director Emmett Malloy followed the band and managed to capture both the special tour, extraordinary concert versions of the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s minimalist, raw, blues-inspired rock songs and the special relationship between the extroverted Jack White and the introspective Meg White ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a formerly married couple who for a long time claimed to be siblings. The film makes striking use of the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s concert colors: red, white and black.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:404f55b97214c46f1f71299bc7dfb946c86cdb00","amp;dn":"The.White.Stripes.Under.Great.White.Northern.Lights.2009.DOCU.FE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"404f55b97214c46f1f71299bc7dfb946c86cdb00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,79,85,185,114,20,196,111,31,113,41,155,199,223,185,70,200,108,219,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
