It was originally released during Golden Week in 1998.\n\nThis is the fansub version released by group AConan, which has since disbanded.\n\n'Shinichi recieves a call from a mysterious person who has been placing bombs all around the city. But was he called randomly, or is something else going on. Maybe more than one reason is 'the case'? Also there may be proof of 'a red thread of fate' between him and Ran.'\n\nThe pacing for this movie is really nice, and it has become one of my all time favourites. This is set sometime between episode 25-50, but can be watched as a stand-alone since it doesn't have any real spoilers past the basic set-up of the series.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7816a9af881171ba4bca2a8f3e33687a207d3ae6","amp;dn":"Detective+Conan+1ST+Movie+%5BCase+Closed%5D+%5BAConan%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7816a9af881171ba4bca2a8f3e33687a207d3ae6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,22,169,175,136,17,113,186,75,202,42,143,62,51,104,122,32,125,58,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
