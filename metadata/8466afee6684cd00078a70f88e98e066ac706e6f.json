ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨And then shot it to pieces?\n\nJOHN COFFEY have worked on their debut album in an abandoned factory in Utrecht, The Netherlands and in tourbusses throughout Europe. The result is a record that will hit listeners like a speeding bullet. Catchy melodies are ruthlessly shot by loud guitar riffs. An unheard form of rock 'n roll in which the band leaves listeners in the dark, not suspecting anything, and pulls the trigger at some point in their songs. A record with a bullet hole straight through it. Vanity just got shot.\n\nTracklist:\n01 Smashing 90s \t\t\t\t\t3:47\n02 Dear Thomas Schell, It was a pleasure meating you\t3:03\n03 VANITY (got shot in the eye last night)\t\t3:02\n04 A Final Leap Ahead \t\t\t\t\t1:18\n05 Stephan's Children \t\t\t\t\t3:07\n06 Fingers and Knives \t\t\t\t\t3:19\n07 Vehicle \t\t\t\t\t\t3:00\n08 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦Meanwhile, at the Dog Track \t\t\t3:34\n09 Wreckage and Scars \t\t\t\t\t3:24\n10 Walls of Infinity\t\t\t\t\t4:16\n\nwww.johncoffey.nl\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8466afee6684cd00078a70f88e98e066ac706e6f","amp;dn":"John_Coffey-Vanity","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8466afee6684cd00078a70f88e98e066ac706e6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,102,175,238,102,132,205,0,7,138,112,248,142,152,224,102,172,112,110,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
