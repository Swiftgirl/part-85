George Jung pursued what he thought was the American Dream. Rather than become just another construction worker like his father, George moves to California where he discovers the profitable pleasures of selling marijuana. A spell in prison introduces him to big-time Colombian dealers, and soon George is involved with their plan to export tons of cocaine to US shores. Becoming fabulously wealthy, he will take a dizzying fall that will knock him out of the underworld.\n\nFor more details about Blow on Blu-ray, see the Blow Blu-ray Review\n\nStarring: Johnny Depp, PenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lope Cruz, Jordi MollÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â , Franka Potente, Rachel Griffiths\nDirector: Ted Demme \n\nBlow 2001 Blu-Ray 1080P/DDTrueHD 5.1 DVD-DL [GR420]\n\nVideo: BLOW BLURAY DISC\nVideo codec: VC-1\nVideo resolution: 1080P (1920X1080)\nAspect ratio: 2.40:1\n\nAudio: English: Dolby Digital TrueHD 5.1 Audio\nYEAR 2001 \nLENGH: 123 mins\nRated R\n\n****************************************************************************\n\nRIPPED JAN 15, 2010 \nNO MENU,TRAILERS, Extra's, STUPID WARNINGS (sorry about no menu)\n\nDISC INFO:\n\nTIME: 02:03.27\nCHAPTERS:26\nAUDIO: DD TrueHD, 6 channel(s) \nVIDEO: 1920X1080, progressive, AVC LEVEL 4.1 (AVCHD)\nPLAYBACK FRAME: 24.00\nDATA RATE: 9026kbps\nTOTAL BITRATE: 9026kbps\n\nDISC REQUIRED TO BURN: DVD-9 DVD+R DL 8.5GB (DUAL LAYER)\n\nNOTE:Burn onto DVD disc (DVD-9 DVD+R DL) in AVCHD format, then it will be playable on Blu-ray Disc players, or on a Playstation 3 gaming console.\n\nPlease leave comments so other people know and appreciate my hard work:) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/grimreaper420/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/grimreaper420/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf anyone is having problems downloading this torrent,\nplease add working trackers to your BT client, now it will DL:)\n\nI will respond to questions, if I am available.\n\nEnjoy, and please seed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5b144db05af76c679e12d452a48bda794922072","amp;dn":"Blow+2001+Blu-Ray+1080P%2FDDTrueHD+5.1+DVD-DL+%5BGR420%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5b144db05af76c679e12d452a48bda794922072","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,177,68,219,5,175,118,198,121,225,45,69,42,72,189,167,148,146,32,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
