This is what I use.\nVLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.\nOne can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.\nQuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.\nPS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.\nAnd please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).\n-------------------------------------------\nREQUESTS ARE &quot;ON HOLD&quot; TILL FURTHER NOTICE.\n-------------------------------------------\n\nNEWSFLASH: From February 20. I entered Mode Three in initial-seeding phase. In short, it means initial seeding &quot;by the numbers&quot; (as written in almost forgotten Rules): the swarm will get exactly as it should be: total exchange between peers divided by the number of peers (seeding=exchange/peers). \nIt counts How much you share (give) to other peers and how fast is your upload to others (don't worry, these are the bytes you got from me and others, not &quot;yours&quot;).\nSo, my dear fellows, step on the breaks even harder - you'll get nowhere. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91c3c73c53a2ccb6887d4d650d3c7bb67325d7c5","amp;dn":"The.Slammin.Salmon.2009.R5.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91c3c73c53a2ccb6887d4d650d3c7bb67325d7c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,195,199,60,83,162,204,182,136,125,77,101,13,60,123,182,115,37,215,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
