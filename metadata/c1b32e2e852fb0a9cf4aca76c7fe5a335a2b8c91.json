I figured someone out \n\nthere maybe lost their game saves and may not want to start from \n\nscratch.  I save pretty frequently -- not all the saves will fit in the \n\ndirectory.  I typically save immediately before a larger battle or event \n\nand immediately after.\n\n\nI played the game through on Medium difficulty.  I rescued all the \n\nlittle sisters, and forgave the NCPs (with the exception of the big guy \n\n-- the third one, as his sane self had requested to be 'set free from \n\nthis mindless nature').\n\n\nBasically, just throw these guys in your Bioshock 2/SaveGames folder \n\nwhich should be located in your My Documents folder.  I believe 30 is \n\nthe limit the game allows, so choose the ones you use wisely!  I \n\ntypically got to 10 saves and then archived the saves from that \n\ndirectory so that I could have more.  :)\n\n\n- Jay Baldwin\nwww.jaybaldwin.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1b32e2e852fb0a9cf4aca76c7fe5a335a2b8c91","amp;dn":"BioShock+2+Game+Saves+%28Medium%2C+Rescue+Little+Sisters%2C+Forgave+Ot","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1b32e2e852fb0a9cf4aca76c7fe5a335a2b8c91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,179,46,46,133,47,176,169,207,74,202,118,199,254,90,51,90,43,140,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
