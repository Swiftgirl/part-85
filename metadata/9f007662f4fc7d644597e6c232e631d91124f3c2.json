For years, he has applied to become a cop, but he always fails the physical exam because he is overweight. One day, a gang of organized criminals put the mall under siege and take hostages. Blart becomes trapped inside, and because of his sense of duty, refuses to leave. He thus becomes the police department's eyes on the inside and attempts to stop the criminals on his own.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n                                   M P A A  R A T I N G  * * * \nRated PG for some violence, mild crude and suggestive humor, and language. \n\n\t                  R E T A I L   R E L E A S E   D A T E  * * *\n\t\t\t\n                                        6 January 2009\t\t                               \n                         T O R R E N T   R E L E A S E   D A T E  * * *\n\t\t\t\t\t01/02/10                           \n\n\t\t\t\tD V D  C o n t e n t  * * * \n  \n        Main Movie ******:\n         * Video - 3128 Kbps - 5 Passes encoded with cce - Widescreen\n         * Audio - English 5.1, \n         * Subs  - English, Spanish \n\n        Menu ************:\n         * Yes\n\n        Extras/Special Features **********:\n         * All, Commentary with writer/director Nora Ephron\n\n        Removed **********:\n         * FBI Warning, Trailers, Adverts,\n\n\n        Chapters ********:\n\n1.
