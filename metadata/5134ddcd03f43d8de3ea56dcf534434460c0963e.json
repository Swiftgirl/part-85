In India he witnesses a total solar eclipse - when the \n       link to the light and heat that sustains us is cut off for a few \n       precious minutes.\n       \n       But heat and light are not the only power of the sun over the \n       solar system. In Norway, Brian watches the battle between the \n       sun's wind and earth, as the night sky glows with the northern \n       lights.\n       \n       Beyond earth, the solar wind continues, creating dazzling aurora \n       on other planets. Brian makes contact with Voyager, a probe that \n       has been travelling since its launch 30 years ago. Now 14 billion \n       kilometres away, Voyager has just detected the solar wind is \n       beginning to peter out. But even here we haven't reached the end \n       of the sun's rule.\n       \n       Brian explains how its greatest power, gravity, reaches out for \n       hundreds of billions of kilometres, where the lightest \n       gravitational touch encircles our solar system in a mysterious \n       cloud of comets.\n\n\n                           Enjoy with AC3 5.1 audio!\n\n\n    \n                                       \n                GROUP  INFORMATION          \n         9 Years of the Force and still    \n                      going strong                  \n     \n\n           What we are looking for:\n\n           * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n           * Fios x264 rippers or cappers\n           * also we have a contest to annouce we are in need of a\n           * new nfo ascii artwork design email us with your designs\n           * winners artwork will be added as our new nfo\n           * dont forget to tag your work\n           * If you think you can help contact us on irc\n           * or email us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;195f766b7a7c59716c6a71377870&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5134ddcd03f43d8de3ea56dcf534434460c0963e","amp;dn":"Wonders.Of.The.Solar.System.S01E01.HDTV.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5134ddcd03f43d8de3ea56dcf534434460c0963e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,52,221,205,3,244,61,141,227,234,86,220,245,52,67,68,96,192,150,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
