One of the things IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve always hoped to do with my music is show that not all hip-hop/rap is naughty words and violent situations. I decided I would put together a little mix CD with a collection of rap tracks (and some other samples) that show the softer side, specifically the appreciation of the fairer sex. To be honest I could of just of thrown together a bunch of tracks by LL Cool J and Common but I decided to dig a little deeper into my collection (although, there is two LL songsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦) (coincidently as I write this IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m also watching a 30 Rock episode which stars Mr Smith)\n\nSo for guys IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve created a CD, injected with my patented charm, which you can give to your special lady to show much you appreciate them. For single girls IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve created a CD which, when listened to, will hopefully refill your confidence in us and make you feel like the princesses you are. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re not all bastards, honest.\n\nAs well as the CD you can also download the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcaseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ for it. Essentially itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a design that fills a piece of paper that will keep your CD safe and looking good. Its based on this guide (which you will want to use). There is 4 different versions. Two have a background, two donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t (to save ink). One of each has the guide lines for folding correctly.\n\nIf youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d like to support this please feel free to throw a little money towards the British Heart Foundation. Everyone needs a heart.\n\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll also take this opportunity to mention that IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve set up a facebook fan page. Feel free to join.\n\nThanks, and happy love day.\n\nTracklist:\n\nDrake - Best I Ever Had\nWale - Pretty Girls Ft.
