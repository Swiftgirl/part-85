Its perfect for downloading files, programs, pictures, audio, video, complete Web sites and complete FTP sites from the Internet.\n\nUnlike other download managers that just download single files, DownloadStudio can download complete Web sites, complete FTP sites, pictures from Web sites, streaming audio and video.\n\nDownloadStudio is an internet download manager with browser integration. Features include fast, multi-connection downloading; visual site explorer; category organizer; built-in thumbnail file browser. The visual site explorer that lets you get 'under-the-hood' of your favorite web sites to see what files are used to make them.\n\nThis allows you to download only the specific files that you are interested in. It has high performance, multi-threaded, multi-connection technologies that allow you to download many files at the same time.\n\nHere are some key features of &quot;DownloadStudio&quot;:\n\nSingle File Downloader:\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Accelerate your downloads from the internet by as much as 500%!\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Resume broken or failed downloads so you'll never lose a download again.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Easy-to-use Download Wizard guides you through all steps to download files, or use Expert mode for one-click downloading, or use silent downloading for no-click downloading.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Supports all popular internet protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, MMS and RTSP.\n\nFile Range Downloader:\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Web sites that have many files often use file-naming conventions whereby they name their content using a series of numbers or letters. For example, a celebrity photo galley site may name its 'Angelina Jolie' photos as jolie001.jpg, jolie002.jpg, jolie003.jpg ? jolie125.jpg. From this, you can see that they are just a series of photos numbered from 1 to 125.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Rather than having to do the tedious job of downloading each photo separately, a File Range Downloader lets you enter the URL for one of the photos and then you can specify the file range for the download. In the above example, it may look like jolie[001-125].jpg. DownloadStudio will download each file in the file range for you. This makes downloading collections of files extremely convenient and well suited to photo gallery sites or music sites.\n\nWeb Site Downloader:\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· DownloadStudio lets you download a complete web site, or to download just certain files that match your criteria from a web site.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Downloading a complete web site allows you to view the web site offline without being connected to the internet. All files for the web site are downloaded and the site is fully functional. This is great for offline browsing, for research purposes and for making regular backups of a web site.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Downloading certain files from a web site based on your criteria is a very powerful downloading technique. For example, it lets you get all images from a web site, or to get all PDF files from a web site, or to get all music from a web site. DownloadStudio lets you specify the criteria that you would like to use when downloading files from a web site. These criteria can include file type, file size, file date, file location and more. For example, you may wish to download all JPEG images that are larger than 50KB from a particular web server. This would allow you to get all the large-sized photos from a photo gallery web site.\n\nStreaming Audio/Video Downloader:\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Streaming audio and video is not like a typical file on the internet that you can download and save onto your computer.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· DownloadStudio can connect to and download audio and video directly from Windows streaming media servers. This lets you play your favorite music and movies (ASF, WMV, WMA, ASX, WVX, WAX) on your computer or media center without being connected to the internet.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Sometimes, web sites refer to streaming meta-files instead of the actual streaming audio or video file. Windows media streaming meta-files have an extension of .WAX, .WVX or .ASX. DownloadStudio can automatically drill into these meta-files and download the actual streaming audio or video for you.\n\nRSS Feed, Blog and Podcast Downloader:\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Web sites and blogs have RSS feeds so that visitors can keep up-to-date with the latest information. Podcasts are a very popular way to listen to the latest music or watch the latest videos.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· DownloadStudio lets you subscribe and download RSS feeds and blogs so that you can view all the content from your favorite feeds. DownloadStudio also lets you download all the links within a feed so you can read the content offline without being connected to the internet.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Podcasts contain enclosure links to music files or video files. DownloadStudio can download and save complete podcasts onto your computer - including all the music and video files, so you can play them or transfer them to your portable media player, such as an Apple iPod or Sony PSP.\n\nDownloadStudio Audio/Video Capture:\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· DownloadStudio contains a specialized audio and video recorder application called DownloadStudio Audio/Video Capture. It lets you capture audio or video as it plays on your computer in your media player or web browser. This lets you save any audio or video from any web site onto your computer.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· DownloadStudio Audio/Video can record all audio and video formats - including streaming audio or video from Windows, Real and QuickTime streaming servers.\n\nDownloadStudio URL Sniffer:\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Some URLs (or web addresses) can be very difficult to find - especially for streaming audio or video playing in your media player or web browser. DownloadStudio has solved this problem with a specialized application called DownloadStudio URL Sniffer.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· When switched on, DownloadStudio URL Sniffer watches your network and internet traffic and finds URLs that pass through this traffic. Once URLs are found, they are listed for you to choose and download using DownloadStudio.\n\nFlash Detection and Capture:\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Macromedia Flash (.SWF) content can be difficult to download or save onto your computer. This is due to additional components (e.g. ActiveX controls) being used in your web browser to display Flash. This is particularly the case for Internet Explorer and Internet Explorer-based web browsers.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· DownloadStudio lets you right-click on Flash content in Internet Explorer and save the Flash files onto your computer.\n\nWeb Site Explorer:\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· If you are having troubles finding the files that you want from a web site or FTP site, you can use DownloadStudio's Browse Internet mode. It is a web site explorer that lets you view all the links and images on a web site. By navigating through these links, you can find the files that you want to download.\n\nRSS Feed Reader:\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Once you have downloaded some RSS feeds, blogs or podcasts using DownloadStudio, you can view them with DownloadStudio's RSS Feed Reader. The RSS Feed Reader lets you view all your feeds, check for updates to feeds, subscribe to new feeds and more.\n\nFile Browser, Viewer and Organizer:\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· DownloadStudio contains a fully-featured, visual file browser that displays thumbnails for all the files that you have downloaded. It works just like Windows Explorer - except that it supports over 150 file formats! The Instant Viewer lets you double-click on thumbnails so you can view your files full-sized or view instant slideshows.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Detailed properties drill into your files to tell you more about your files than ever before. Its just like having ACDSee, Irfanview or Compupic built into your download manager!\n\nWorks With All Popular Web Browsers:\nDownloadStudio works with the latest versions of all popular web browsers:\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Firefox 1.0 or higher\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Mozilla 1.0 or higher\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Opera 7.0 or higher\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Netscape 7.0 or higher\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Internet Explorer 5.0 or higher\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Internet Explorer-based browsers, including: Maxthon, NetCaptor, Avant Browser\n\nDownloadStudio integrates more features into your web browser than any other download manager:\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Advanced click monitoring - lets you catch all your download clicks so you will never have to download the slow way again.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Download toolbar - lets you download files and web pages as you browse web sites.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Right-click menus - lets you download links, images, links, pages and web sites.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Drag-and-drop - lets you drag-and-drop selected web page content and quickly download all the links.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Flash detection and saving - lets you save Flash content onto your computer.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· All features can be turned on/off in your web browser.\n\nRequirements:\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Intel Pentium 500Mhz or greater/ AMD Athlon 500Mz or greater processor\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Minimum of 512MB RAM (1GB or higher required for Windows Vista)\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Minimum of 50MB hard disk space\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Graphics card set to 16 bit or higher resolution (1024x768 screen resolution or greater)\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Internet Explorer version 5.0 or greater\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Windows Media Format Runtime 9 or higher\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· WinPcap Windows packet capture library\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Internet connection\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· For capturing audio and video, it is recommended to have: Intel Pentium 1.5Ghz or greater/ AMD Athlon 1.5Gz or greater processor; 512MB RAM or higher\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· For detecting Flash content in Internet Explorer: Flash Player 7.0 or greater\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· For displaying AI, EPS and PDF thumbnails: Ghostscript 8.0\n\nOS: Windows 2K / XP / 2003 / Vista \n\n***************************************************************************\nxoxoxoxoxox\nx N O T E x\nxoxoxoxoxox\n\n1.

Why??'\nA: It's because you're missing certain codecs. There's 2 option to this ; \n   \n   OPTION 1: Download &amp; install the free K-Lite Mega Codec Pack here: \n\n  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Mega_Codec_Pack.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Mega_Codec_Pack.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n   \n   OPTION 2: Download &amp; install VLC Media Player here: http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ ; use it to play the movie/video file which you've downloaded\n\nQ: 'I download a keygen from a user &amp; my AV flagged it as a virus!'\nA: It MIGHT be false positives flagged by your AV, OR it might really be a virus. \n\n   First, look at the uploader. Does he has a skull(pink/green) with him? If yes, most probably that keygen is NOT infected.\n   \n   However, on a safe side, what you can do is download the similar torrent from another skulled user &amp; check if your AV flagged it as infected of not. \n\n   IF NO, high chances the previous torrent perhaps IS infected.\n   IF YES, most probably it's false positive.\n\n   Well, if you're still unsure, you can just drop by to our forum &amp; report it here: \n  &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt; ; the staff will gladly double-check it.                                                                    \n\nQ: 'I can no longer log into my account on TPB.
