The film follows the adolescents over a three-year-period, focusing on the relationship between Jonas and Agnete, which is made difficult by misconceptions, Agnete's interest for philosophy and Jonas's friend Toke, her father's mental illness and Jonas's own indecision regarding his feelings for her. The story ends when the protagonists finish school.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fdc3bcdae8856fa27267da736df4ce4e328534e","amp;dn":"Aching.Hearts.2009.DVDRip.XviD-LAP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fdc3bcdae8856fa27267da736df4ce4e328534e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,220,59,205,174,136,86,250,39,38,125,167,54,223,76,228,227,40,83,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
