Within this second album, Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â«Mind Necrosis FactorÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» mixes acoustic instruments and shooting rhythms, tribal cries and post-industrial atmospheres. More than genesis of a new shape, this album relates the emergence of a mind, from the obscurity of the first moments to pain cessation. It invites us to look beyond the flesh, to feel the breath of the hidden self inside us. \n\n1. Obskur (5:26)\n\n2. Beyond the flesh (3:43)\n\n3. Atman (3:49)\n\n4. Song of dunes (5:43)\n\n5.
