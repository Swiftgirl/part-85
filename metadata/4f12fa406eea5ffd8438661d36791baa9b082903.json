Now Or Never\n\n\nA veteran of the St. Louis blues scene, Henry Townsend is a true marvel, having recorded in each of the last eight decades, a truly astounding achievement. Blessed with an easy, natural blues voice, a string-snapping acoustic guitar style he learned from old running mate Henry Spaulding, and a down to earth piano approach, Townsend is a living, breathing national treasure. Cairo Blues was originally released in 1969, and this reissue has been long overdue. Working with veteran guitarist Mike Stewart, Townsend delivers a sprightly set of acoustic gems, including a nod to his old friend Spaulding, whose only known recordings, 1929's &quot;Cairo Blues&quot; and &quot;Biddle Street Blues,&quot; are covered here. &quot;Deep Morgan Stomp&quot; is another highlight, while the two piano tracks, &quot;She Just Walked Away&quot; and &quot;Heart Trouble,&quot; are charming and intimate, even though the piano is slightly out of tune. Townsend has never made a bad album, but Cairo Blues has a wonderful and intangible warmth that makes it a good introduction to this absolute last of the great country blues players of the 1920s.
