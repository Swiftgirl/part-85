Key\n\nHard Disk Sentinel (HDSentinel) is a multi-OS HDD monitoring and HDD analysis \napplication. Its goal is to find, test, diagnose and repair hard disk drive problems, \nreport and display HDD health, performance degradations and failures. Hard Disk \nSentinel gives complete textual description, tips and displays/reports the most \ncomprehensive information about the HDD inside the computer or in an external \nenclosure (USB / e-SATA). Many different alerts and report options are available \nto ensure maximum safety of your valuable data. \n\nHard Disk Sentinel monitors hard disk drive / HDD status, including health, \ntemperature and all S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology, \nbuilt in most hard disks today) values for each hard disks. Also it measures the hard \ndisk transfer speed in real time which can be used as a benchmark or to detect \npossible hard disk failures, performance degradations. \n\nHDSentinel is the perfect data protection solution: it can be effectively used to \nprevent HDD failure and HDD data loss because it has the most sensitive hard disk \nhealth rating system which is extremely sensitive to disk problems. This way even \na small HDD problem can't be missed. The Professional version has scheduled and \nautomatic (on-problem) disk backup options to prevent data loss caused by not only \nfailure but by malware or accidental delete also. \n\nEasy to use interface \nAll information are displayed in the main window of the application. Quick controls \nallow easy navigation to access all hard disks, partitions and different information. \nIntuitive user interface elements display information by using green/yellow/red color \nto indicate the level of problem. Detailed text description and context sensitive help \nguides the user thru the features and options. \n\n1. Install &gt; 2. Configure &gt; 3. Stay protected \nJust install, configure alerts and backup options and your system is now safe. \nYou'll be notified about the problems - but if everything is correct, Hard Disk Sentinel \njust sits on tray and displays current status. The data is protected 24 hours daily, \n7 days a week. \n\nInstant S.M.A.R.T. analysing \nHard Disk Sentinel can communicate with IDE, Serial ATA, SCSI and some special \nUSB hard disks to detect their status and temperature. Disk status are displayed \nimmediately as you launch the application, there is no need to analyse disks for a \nlong period. It displays the current and maximum temperature for the hard disk. \nIt reads all general and vendor-specific attributes and monitor their values. \nFor advanced users, all raw data are displayed also including power-on time and \nnumber of read/write errors. Hard Disk Sentinel interprets the performance and fitness \nrelated S.M.A.R.T. values and displays the calculated Performance and Health \npercentage, total power on time and estimated lifetime remaining. \n\nDisk status in Windows Explorer \n \nView the current health status and used space in Windows \nExplorer or in any other application, so you'll always know the \namount of used space for each partitions and the disk condition. \nHard disk health and used space displayed on disk icons \n\nInformation on demand \nCurrent hard disk temperatures and health can be displyed on the system tray, \nin a small status window and on the desktop itself. Average and maximum \ntemperatures are logged for all hard disks and these informations are displayed \nin graphs for statistical purposes. \n\nHard Disk Hardware Testing \nBy using Hard Disk Sentinel, it is possible to start hardware hard disk self tests. \nThese tests can be used to effectively find all hard disk problems because built-in \nhardware methods are used to verify hard disk components (for example heads, \nservo, internal buffer in the Short self test). The Extended self test also verifies the \ncomplete disk surface, finds and repairs all &quot;weak&quot; areas and re-allocates the possible \nbad sectors. This is not possible with the software-based disk surface scan methods \n(for example, by using scandisk). \n\nLogging \nHard Disk Sentinel logs all degradations in all SMART parameters. For example, \nif a new uncorrectable sector is found on your hard disk, you will be notified. \n\nAlerts \nHard Disk Sentinel can make different kind of alerts upon different problems. \nIt can execute various tasks (even external applications) in case of a problem. \nThere is an option to send daily emails about current status. \n\nHard Disk Details \nDetects and displays every information about the hard disk, from the revision number \nand buffer size to all features it has. The maximum available and current transfer \nmodes are also displayed. \n\nHard Disk Performance \nLogs how much data were read from or written to the hard disk. Displays current \ntransfer rates for both reading and writing and estimates the maximum available \n(theoretical) transfer rate for a particular hard disk. \n\nHard Disk Partitions \nDisplays partitions for each physical hard disks and type and usage informations \nabout them so you cannot run out of space. Hard Disk Sentinel sends this information \nautomatically in alert/status messages. \n\nShutdown \nIt offers option to shut down the computer on failure, overheat or parameter \ndegradation. This option can be used to prevent further data loss. \n\nAcoustic Management \nOffers option to control the acoustic level of IDE/S-ATA hard disk. It is possible \nto increase performance or make the disks more silent. Unique feature: control the \nacoustic level of your external USB hard disk (if your USB enclosure is built around \nCypress AT2+ chip). \n\nClock Synchronization \nIt offers option to synchronize the PC clock with an atomic clock via NTP (Network Time Protocol). \n\nBackup \nIn the Professional version, wide range of backup methods are available: to backup data to local computer, to a LAN server or to a remote FTP (or to a mail) server. \nIt is even possible to use 3rd party tools to create archives or burn media. \nHard Disk Sentinel can manage power status of remote computers in the network. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e8e6676a86da56c0a68150edd0f9757e9ebe45e","amp;dn":"Hard+Disk+Sentinel+Pro+v2.80.3083+Inc.patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e8e6676a86da56c0a68150edd0f9757e9ebe45e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,142,102,118,168,109,165,108,10,104,21,14,221,15,151,87,233,235,228,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
