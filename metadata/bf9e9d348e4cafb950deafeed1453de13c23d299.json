This includes adjusting various gameplay elements including physics, visual effects and overall game play formats. Along with changes to how the game handles, the PR team has introduced the British, Russian, Taliban and Insurgent factions, plus a number of community assisted factions are currently in the works to introduce Canadian, IDF forces and multiple others to the virtual battlefield.\n\nProject Reality has won second place two years running in ModDB.com's annual Mod of the Year competition (2006 &amp; 2007), culminating in first place in 2008. The competition is the definitive event that showcases the best mods and indie games in the world and recognizes the teams behind them.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.realitymod.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.realitymod.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf9e9d348e4cafb950deafeed1453de13c23d299","amp;dn":"Project.Reality.v0.9.Battlefield.2.BF2.FULL.MOD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf9e9d348e4cafb950deafeed1453de13c23d299","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,158,157,52,142,76,175,185,80,222,175,238,209,69,61,225,60,35,210,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
