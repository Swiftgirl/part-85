Along with Fatboy Slim, The Chemical Brothers and The Crystal Method, as well as other acts they are pioneers of the big beat electronic dance genre which achieved mainstream popularity in the 1990s and 2000s, and are known for high-quality live performances. They have sold nearly 20 million records worldwide which is unequalled in dance music history.\n\nTheir music consists of various styles ranging from rave, hardcore, industrial and breakbeat in the early 1990s to electronic rock with punk vocal elements in later times. The current band members include Liam Howlett (composer/keyboards), Keith Flint (dancer/vocalist) and Maxim Reality (MC/vocalist). Leeroy Thornhill (dancer/very occasional live keyboards) was a member of the band from 1990 to 2000, as was a female dancer/vocalist called Sharky who left the band during their early period. The Prodigy first emerged on the underground rave scene in the early 1990s, and have since then achieved immense popularity and worldwide renown. Some of their most popular songs include &quot;Charly&quot;, &quot;Out of Space&quot;, &quot;No Good (Start the Dance)&quot;, &quot;Voodoo People&quot;, &quot;Poison&quot;, &quot;Firestarter&quot;, &quot;Breathe&quot;, &quot;Smack My Bitch Up&quot;, &quot;Omen&quot; &amp; &quot;Warrior's Dance.&quot;\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Prodigy - Invaders Must Die SE 2CD 2009 FLAC SPR\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRipped by: Unknown\nTorrent by: SPR\n\nRLS Link: http://www.discogs.com/Prodigy-Invaders-Must-Die-Special-Edition/release/1996062\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSelected Bitrate: 768 kBit/s\nQuality: High\n#CDs: 2\n*.Rip Logs: Yes\n*.Cue Files: Yes\n\nFLAC - Free Lossless Audio Codec\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTRACKLIST\n\nCD1\n\n01 Invaders Must Die\n02 Omen\n03 Thunder\n04 Colours\n05 Take Me To The Hospital\n06 Warriors Dance\n07 Run With The Wolves\n08 Omen Reprise\n09 World's On Fire\n10 Piranha\n11 Stand Up\n12 The Big Gundown\n13 Wild West\n14 Omen (Live)\n\nCD2\n\n01 Invaders Must Die (Liam H Re-amped)\n02 Invaders Must Die (Chase &amp; Statusremix)\n03 Omen (Noisia Remix)\n04 Omen (Herve Remix)\n05 Warriors Dance (Future Funk Squadremix)\n06 Warriors Dance (Benga Remix)\n07 Warriors Dance (South Central Remix)\n08 Take Me To The Hospital (Rusko Remix)\n09 Take Me To The Hospital (Subfocusremix)\n10 Take Me To The Hospital (Josh Homme &amp; Liam H's Wreckage Mix)\n11 Take Me To The Hospital (Loser Middlesex A &amp; E Remix)\n12 Invaders Must Die (Yuksek Remix)\n13 Thunder (Bang Gang Remix)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf You Like It - Buy It!\n\nPLS Seed After You!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:078dc597090c539454e19dfcf17d0d985937be9c","amp;dn":"The_Prodigy-Invaders_Must_Die-SE-2CD-2009-FLAC-SPR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"078dc597090c539454e19dfcf17d0d985937be9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,141,197,151,9,12,83,148,84,225,157,252,241,125,13,152,89,55,190,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
