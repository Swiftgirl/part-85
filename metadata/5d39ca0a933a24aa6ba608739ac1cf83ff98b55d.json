He applies the same gothic operatic touch that made his work \nwith Meat Loaf so captivating (and successful), wrapping the songs in \natmospheric, all-stops-out arrangements that blend drama and power chords in \nequal measure. The combination of Steinman's cinematic production style with \nTylers smoky vocals made Faster Than the Speed of Night her most successful \nalbum.\n \nIt also spawned a huge hit single in &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart,&quot; an epic \nballad about longing for a lost love that starts as a quiet piano-led piece \nand builds into a gargantuan production built on an equal balance of power \nhords and thick choral vocals. The title track, a romantic rocker that blends \nlighting-fast piano runs with metallic guitar soloing from Rick Derringer, \nalso got a decent amount of radio play. \n\nThe remainder of the album has Tyler turning her attention to cover versions, \nincluding a Phil Spector-styled remake of Bryan Adams &quot;Straight From the Heart&quot; \nand a radically rearranged version of &quot;Have You Ever Seen the Rain?&quot; that \ntransforms the song into an arena rock tune built on a complex, classical-styled \npiano riff from Roy Bittan.\n \nThe standout among the cover versions is &quot;Tears,&quot; a heart-tugging power \nballad that Tyler performs as a duet with its author, Frankie Miller. \nSince Miller's gruff voice is close in style to Tyler's, their duet has a \nspecial chemistry and they milk the song for every drop of drama it has to \noffer. \n\nThis combination of bombast and melodrama could have worn thin quickly, \nbut Steinman keeps things moving smoothly by carefully pacing all the songs and \nthrowing in odd, ear-catching elements to keep things interesting (example: the \nchanting children's chorus that introduces &quot;Goin' Through the Motions&quot;). All in \nall, Faster Than Speed of the Night remains Bonnie Tyler's finest and most \nconsistent achievement on record. It's a must for anyone interested in her work \nand a worthwhile purchase for anyone who enjoys rock at its most melodramatic. \n\n__________\n\n\n1.
