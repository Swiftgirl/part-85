We recorded this in the spring of 08.  We had nothing but an old dual deck tape recorder/player that we rigged up with a mic in the back of the room to catch playing live.  Quality is not very good, but I can't say the music doesn't rock!  maybe some of you will do me the ultimate honor and cover one of these and someday I'll hear it elsewhere.\n\nThere are two takes of most of these with different tonal qualities to get a better idea of the track.  Enjoy.\n\nEhren Stellrecht - Vocals, guitar\nDave Hirsch - Bass, vocals\nTad Weigand - Drums, vocals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80c245f148da95373401148b5d363de8817f70eb","amp;dn":"TED-+Hateful+Vengence","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80c245f148da95373401148b5d363de8817f70eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,194,69,241,72,218,149,55,52,1,20,139,93,54,61,232,129,127,112,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
