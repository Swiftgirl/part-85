Gary Lachman; bass) and Clement Burke (b. 24 November 1955, \nNew York, USA; drums) joined Harry and Stein in a reshaped unit that \nsecured a recording contract through the aegis of producer \nRichard Gottehrer.\n\nBlondie was indebted to both contemporary punk and 60s girl groups, \nadeptly combining melody with purpose, although not a runaway \ncommercial success.\n_________\n\n 1 Blondie -  One Way Or Another \n \n \n 2 Blondie -  Hanging On The Telephone \n \n \n 3 Blondie -  Heart Of Glass \n \n \n 4 Blondie -  Union City Blue \n \n \n 5 Blondie -  (Im Always Touched By Your) Presence, Dear \n \n \n 6 Jazz Passengers, The -  Imitation Of A Kiss \n  Vocals [Featuring] - Deborah Harry\n \n 7 Blondie -  The Dreams Lost On Me \n \n \n 8 Jazz Passengers, The -  When The Fog Lifts \n  Vocals [Featuring] - Deborah Harry\n \n 9 Jazz Passengers, The -  Tide Is High \n  Vocals [Featuring] - Deborah Harry\n\n10 Blondie -  End To End \n_________\n\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFile size                        : 11.6 MiB\nDuration                         : 5mn 4s\nOverall bit rate                 : 320 Kbps\nAlbum                            : Personal Collection\nTrack name                       : One Way Or Another\nTrack name/Position              : 1\nPerformer                        : Blondie\nWriting library                  : LAME3.98.2\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nFormat_Settings_Mode             : Joint stereo\nDuration                         : 5mn 4s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz\nResolution                       : 16 bits\nStream size                      : 11.6 MiB (100%)\nWriting library                  : LAME3.98.2\n________\n\nMp3\n\nRipped:320\n\nEnjoy:D\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc7daf647586e7191c084f723a2a2053dba19223","amp;dn":"Blondie+-+Personal+Collection%28mo3+320kbs%29ICM369","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc7daf647586e7191c084f723a2a2053dba19223","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,125,175,100,117,134,231,25,28,8,79,114,58,42,32,83,219,161,146,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
