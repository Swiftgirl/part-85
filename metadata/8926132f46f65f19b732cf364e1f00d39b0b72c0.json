Pesce\nStarring: Vinnie Jones Tommy Flanagan Tom Berenger\n\nWalter Weed is an unassuming desk jockey at the FBI when the Bureau uncovers a plot to assassinate himÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\n*** Small-sized 2-pass re-encode of DVD rip for computers (PC, Mac), PS3 or Xbox, portable and mobile devices (Ipod, Itouch) . ***\n*** Video is 480x272 H264; audio is 44.1 kHz/stereo AAC LC and container is MP4. ***\n\nI can recommend CoreCodec for H264 (avc1, x264) video-playback, free DivX 7 for AAC sound-playback (and .mkv with AAC), Haali splitter (free, comes with CoreCodec) as the fastest and best combination for Windows Media Player. This is what I use.\nVLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.\nOne can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.\nQuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.\nPS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.\nAnd please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).Many of movies I encode have embedded subtitles. So far, only VLC player is able to use them correctly.\n\nInput:  Smokin.Aces.2.Assassins.Ball.UNRATED.DVDRip.XviD-BULLDOZER\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8926132f46f65f19b732cf364e1f00d39b0b72c0","amp;dn":"Smokin.Aces.2.Assassins.Ball.UNRATED.DVDRip.H264%5BREQ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8926132f46f65f19b732cf364e1f00d39b0b72c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,38,19,47,70,246,95,25,183,50,207,54,78,31,0,211,155,11,114,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
