concrete turned to dust,\nAnd the steel turned into rust,\nAll I could think was I need a way to dig through the damage,\nCouldn't think of a way to get through this,\nNow I see you takin advantage,\nAnd I found another reason to do this.\n\nI'm diggin us a hole to travel through,\nI wanna find a way to rattle you,\nYou wanna try to hear the thunder hit,\nYou're gonna have to follow me under it.\nLet go, it's begun,\nClose your eyes, I'm not done,\nBreathe a word, and waste your breath,\nAnd keep it up till there's nothing left.\n\nNow, that I said goodbye,\nJust as the darkness turned to light,\nJust as the next light turns to day,\nAnd the world gets underway,\nAll I can see is the anticipation,\nWaiting to take this out on the wind and the raindrops,\nAnd I waited patiently taking it in,\nReady for the first of the face offs.\n\nI'm diggin us a hole to travel through,\nI wanna find a way to rattle you,\nYou wanna try to hear the thunder hit,\nYou're gonna have to follow me under it.\nLet go, it's begun,\nClose your eyes, I'm not done,\nBreathe a word, and waste your breath,\nAnd keep it up till there's nothing left.\n\nI'm diggin us a hole to travel through,\nI wanna find a way to rattle you,\nYou wanna try to hear the thunder hit,\nYou're gonna have to follow me under it.\n\nI'm diggin us a hole to travel through,\nI wanna find a way to rattle you,\nYou wanna try to hear the thunder hit,\nYou're gonna have to follow me under it.\n\nI'm diggin us a hole to travel through,\nI wanna find a way to rattle you,\nYou wanna try to hear the thunder hit,\nYou're gonna have to follow me under it.\nLet go, it's begun,\nClose your eyes, I'm not done,\nBreathe a word, and waste your breath,\nAnd keep it up till there's nothing left.\n\nNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFear (Leave Out All The Rest demo 2006)\n\n\nLooked in the ocean,\nLooked in the sea,\nFound her laughing,\nWatching for me,\nLeft the door open,\nLeft the door wide,\n(unintelligible),\nKept it inside.\n\n(Nonsense rapping)\nDon't trust if you don't then you're fightin' for what?\n\nFightin' for a place,\nWe can call home.\nLookin' for a way,\nNot be alone.\nI'm fightin' for a place,\nWe can call home.\nLookin' for a way,\nNot to be alone,\nNot to be alone.\n\nDuh nuh nuh,\nDuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh,\nNuh nuh nuh nuh nuhuhh.\n\nDuh nuh nuh,\nDuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh,\nNuh nuh nuh nuh nuhuhh.\n\nDuh nuh nuh,\nDuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh,\nNuh nuh nuh nuh nuhuhh.\n\nDuh nuh nuh,\nDuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh,\nNuh nuh nuh nuh nuhuhh.\n\nDuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuhuhh.\n\nFightin' for a place,\nWe can call home.\nLookin' for a way,\nNot be alone.\nI'm fightin' for a place,\nWe can call home.\nLookin' for a way,\nNot to be alone,\nNot to be alone.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFigure.09 (demo 2002)\n\n\nAll these things I could not say,\nmade me so much more afraid.\nJust too scared of what I'd find,\nto look behind, to look behind.\n\nAll these things I could not say,\nmade me so much more afraid.\nJust too scared of what I'd find,\nto look behind, to look behind.\n\nIf you go, there's no turning back.\nIf you go, there's no turning back.\nIf you go, there's no turning back.\nthere's no turning back!\n\nNo, no, no, no, no, no...\nNOOOOO!\nNO TURNING BACK!\nNOOOOO!\nNO TURNING BACK!\nNOOOOO!\nNO TURNING BACK!\nNOOOOO!\nNO TURNING BACK!\n\nAll these things I could not say,\nmade me so much more afraid.\nJust too scared of what I'd find,\nto look behind.\n\nAll of these things I could not say,\nmade me so much more afraid.\nJust too scared of what I'd find,\nto look behind, CAN'T LOOK BEHIND!\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAcross The Line\n\n\nIn this desert,\nIn darkness,\nLying with the gun across his chest.\nPretending,\nHe's heartless,\nAs the fire flashes in the sky.\nHe was fragile,\nAnd frozen,\nWhen the bullet took away his friend.\nAnd now he's somehow,\nMore broken.\n\nHe's pulling his weapon to his side,\nLoading it full of his goodbyes,\nHolding an enemy across the line.\nHe's pulling his weapon to his side,\nLoading it full of his goodbyes,\nHolding an enemy across the line.\n\nSweating,\nAnd shaking,\nLying with her hands across her chest.\nShe wakes with,\nHer cravings,\nAs the fire flashes in her eye.\nShe was fragile,\nAnd frozen,\nWhen the needle took away her friend,\nBut now she's somehow,\nMore broken.\n\nShe's pulling her weapon to her side,\nLoading it full of her goodbyes,\nHolding an enemy across the line.\nShe's pulling her weapon to her side,\nLoading it full of her goodbyes,\nHolding an enemy across the line.\n\nWith every battle he's chosing,\nWith every fight he's losing,\nHis enemy's not far behind.\nWith every promise she's broken,\nWith every lie she's spoken,\nHer enemy's not far behind.\n\nIt's your time.\nIt's your time.\nIt's your time.\nIt's - your - TIME!\n\nHe's pulling his weapon to his side,\nLoading it full of his goodbyes,\nHolding an enemy across the line.\nHe's pulling his weapon to his side,\nLoading it full of his goodbyes,\nHolding an enemy across the line.\n\nShe's pulling her weapon to her side,\nLoading it full of her goodbyes,\nHolding an enemy across the line.\nShe's pulling her weapon to her side,\nLoading it full of her goodbyes,\nHolding an enemy across the line.\n\nWith every battle he's chosing,\nWith every fight he's losing,\nHis enemy's not far behind.\nWith every promise she's broken,\nWith every lie she's spoken,\nHer enemy's not far behind.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDrum Song (The Little Things Give You Away demo 2006)\n\n\nDuhh nuhh
