Lavigne described the song as &quot;a little darker&quot; and confirmed the lyrics, &quot;trippin' out, spinnin' around, I'm underground, I fell down.&quot;\n\nAlmost Alice is a soundtrack to Tim Burton's film, Alice in Wonderland, composed of various artists' music inspired by the film.\n\nThe lead single, &quot;Alice&quot; by Avril Lavigne will be played during the end credits.
