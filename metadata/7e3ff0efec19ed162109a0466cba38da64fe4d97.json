Former Democratic Party Chairman Howard Dean said:\n\n&quot;I know health reform when I see it, and there isn't much left in the Senate bill.&quot;\n\nHeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s right. It isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œreformÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. But expanding the governmentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s role in healthcare isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t reform either. And why does the media call what Congress does, health ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œreformÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½?  The definition of reform is: making something better. I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know that what Congress does will make our system better. Much of what Congress does makes life worse.\n\nTonightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s show (8pm ET / 5pm PT) is about governmentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s promises.  The ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œreformersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ say they will improve American health care, and slow the growth in costs.  To believe that Congress will do this is magical thinking.  They wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t keep costs under control. Medicare was supposed to cost $12 billion a year by 1990, but the actual cost was $110 billion. In the UK, the government-run system has tripled per-person spending since 1990 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a much bigger increase than is the US.\n\nMy studio audience includes single-payer activists and members of the NYU Young Communist Club.  They will give Whole FoodsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ CEO John Mackey and me a hard time.  MackeyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s stores were boycotted by ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œprogressivesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ after he wrote an Op Ed that was critical of Government-Care.\n\nHope you can join us tonight on Fox Business.  If you cannot, the health care show will be re-broadcast Friday night at 10 (against my old program, 20/20!), Saturday at 7PM EST, and Sunday at 11PM EST.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e3ff0efec19ed162109a0466cba38da64fe4d97","amp;dn":"Stossel+-+%5BPaying+for+Healthcare%5D+-+Fox+Business+-+S01E02+-+CF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e3ff0efec19ed162109a0466cba38da64fe4d97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,63,240,239,236,25,237,22,33,9,160,70,108,186,56,218,100,254,77,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
