He was looking for Ambassador       \n Spock, who is a child on Vulcan at that time, disdained by his neighbors     \n for his half-human nature. Twenty years later, Kirk has grown into a young   \n troublemaker inspired by Capt. Christopher Pike to fulfill his potential in  \n Starfleet even as he annoys his instructors like young Lt. Spock. Suddenly,  \n there is an emergency at Vulcan and the newly commissioned USS Enterprise    \n is crewed with promising cadets like Nyota Uhura, Hikaru Sulu, Pavel Chekov  \n and even Kirk himself thanks to Leonard McCoy's medical trickery. Together,  \n this crew will have an adventure in the final frontier where the old legend  \n is altered forever even as the new version of it is just beginning.          \n                                                                              \n\n\n                           Happy Hacker Industries                            \nThis movie should play fine on most DVD/DivX Certified settop\ndvd players.
