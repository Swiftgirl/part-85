And I want to thank the many heroes who will make crudely drawn MS Paint comics about video games, the neckbearded fanboys and fangirls drawing hilarious rule #34 and those who will make threads with original content even when it's not funny, because it's that creative spirit that shapes our culture and not the people sitting on their high horses comparing everything to the Renaissance masters.\n\nFor more details check the image associated with the torrent on the image board you found this torrent mentioned on.&quot;\n\nAll I did was unrar and rerar into individual categories.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e04b545efb133e8e3cdc02096e07272995c2589c","amp;dn":"A+collection+of+culture+%28better%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e04b545efb133e8e3cdc02096e07272995c2589c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,75,84,94,251,19,62,142,60,220,2,9,110,7,39,41,149,194,88,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
