However, the bank refuses to loan US$ 50,000.00 to them and without alternatives, Max accepts the invitation of his former partner Sydney and his associate Vince to participate in the kidnapping of the eight year old David, the son of a wealthy woman in New England, under the command of a mysterious leader. The quartet drives with the boy to a camping area in Maine, closed in the cold winter. Soon, Max will wish that he had never kidnapped David, much less even heard of him.
