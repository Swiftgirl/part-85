With only one month to discover and claim the inheritance, Amal's struggles with duty and wealth are threatened by all those around him - from a young injured beggar girl and a lovely store merchant, to the danger of the old man's upper-caste friends and siblings, all seeking to claim their share of the riches.\n\nOriginal: vmt - subs added (credit where credit is due)\n\nENJOY","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb000cd8c99b2ad1cfe48bdb0aa7ed9c25a81c04","amp;dn":"Amal.2007.DVDRip.XviD%5BSubs.Hardcoded.EN%5D.Ag.Ro.Ni.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb000cd8c99b2ad1cfe48bdb0aa7ed9c25a81c04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,0,12,216,201,155,42,209,207,228,139,219,10,167,237,156,37,168,28,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
