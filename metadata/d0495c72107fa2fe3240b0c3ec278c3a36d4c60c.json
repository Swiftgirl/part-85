A rumor circulated that the album was released on September 10, 2001, the day before the September 11, 2001 attacks, but this is untrue. According to Amazon.com, the album was officially released September 4, 2001, exactly one week before the attacks. An interview with Stylus Magazine claims the album was available as early as August 24, 2001. Members of the band told Stylus that they had the artwork and idea for the liner notes for over a year before the attacks on the World Trade Center.\nThe track &quot;Have You Passed Through This Night?&quot; is one of the first Explosions in the Sky songs to contain any words: a sample from the film The Thin Red Line.\nThe track title &quot;With Tired Eyes, Tired Minds, Tired Souls, We Slept&quot; was used as an episode title for a landmark episode of Season 3 of the television show One Tree Hill.\nThe artwork for the album, by David Logan, was inspired by The Angel of Mons.\n\n\n&quot;Greet Death&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:19\n&quot;Yasmin the Light&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:03\n&quot;The Moon Is Down&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 10:02\n&quot;Have You Passed Through This Night?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:19\n&quot;A Poor Man's Memory&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:04\n&quot;With Tired Eyes, Tired Minds, Tired Souls, We Slept&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 12:04","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0495c72107fa2fe3240b0c3ec278c3a36d4c60c","amp;dn":"Explosions+in+the+Sky+-+Those+Who+Tell+the+Truth+Shall+Die%2C+Thos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0495c72107fa2fe3240b0c3ec278c3a36d4c60c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,73,92,114,16,127,162,254,50,64,176,195,236,39,140,58,54,212,198,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
