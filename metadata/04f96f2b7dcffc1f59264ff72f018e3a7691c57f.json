Jeremiah Wright, Jr &quot;America's chickens have come home to roost&quot; - in relation to 9/11 attacks\nHow Mr. Obama and his family could sit in the pews of Rev Wright's church for 20 years and not hear his views is beyond most people ?\nDid he hear ? Did he hear and not listen ?  Did he listen and not understand the reverend's views ?  Yet Mr. Obama took the title from his autobiography  The Audacity to Hope sermon from which the title of Barack Obama's book, The Audacity of Hope, is derived.
