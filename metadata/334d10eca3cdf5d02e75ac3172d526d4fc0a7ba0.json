What Really Happened is proud to be one of the oldest political blogs on the net.\nRivero runs the WhatReallyHappened radio show on GCN six days a week, and makes good use of his sharp wit to help his blog visitors and radio listeners not only to read/hear the news but to understand what IS really happening. \n\n===============================================================\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:334d10eca3cdf5d02e75ac3172d526d4fc0a7ba0","amp;dn":"What+Really+Happened+-+Feb+22+MO+%5Bsebaygo1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"334d10eca3cdf5d02e75ac3172d526d4fc0a7ba0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,77,16,236,163,205,245,208,46,117,172,49,114,213,38,212,252,10,123,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
