The members are yet to be named, but it will be interesting to see the composition of the group and what solutions they might devise to climb out of the economic pit largely created by the Bush administrationsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ endless war spending, tax cuts for the rich, and the deregulation on the banking and mortgage industries that allowed so many Americans to pile up mountains of debt that could never be fully repaid.\n\nIn other news, Chief Architect and Turd Blossom extraordinaire Karl Rove has crept back into the headlines with an article in the Wall Street Journal detailing his advice and talking points for the Tea Party Movement.  Uh oh, looks like heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s up to his old king-making antics again.  Or would that be queen?\n\nFinally, former Top Cop Bernie Kerik ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the man Bush wanted to head the Department of Homeland Security ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ heads to prison for a 4-year sentence for eight counts of felony tax fraud and lying to White House officials.  Gee, now if we could just send some of those lying White House officials to the Big House, then justice would be served!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1683bce3b0a91d624e32d7ec8d2022dd4c9fb9f6","amp;dn":"Mike+Malloy+Show+-+Feb+18+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1683bce3b0a91d624e32d7ec8d2022dd4c9fb9f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,131,188,227,176,169,29,98,78,50,215,236,141,32,34,221,76,159,185,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
