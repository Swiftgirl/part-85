Whole Lotta Love \n\nFollowing a successful collaboration at a 1999 London benefit show, it made perfect sense for Jimmy Page to invite the ...    Full DescriptionBlack Crowes to be his back-up band for a mini-tour later that year. Recorded during a pair of sold-out shows at Los Angeles' Greek Theatre, these sets are dominated by Led Zeppelin tunes, along with a mix of classic blues nuggets and covers of Fleetwood Mac and Page's first group, The Yardbirds. (Due to contractual obligations, no Crowes songs are included here).\n\nChris Robinson's soulful singing ably fills in for Robert Plant's caterwaul, particularly with the sinister &quot;In My Time of Dying&quot; and the bluesy drawl of Willie Dixon's &quot;You Shook Me.&quot; Guitarists Rich Robinson and Audley Freed provide stellar sounding layers of depth behind Page's playing, whether on the chiming &quot;Hey Hey What Can I Do,&quot; or the hard-hitting swagger of &quot;Nobody's Fault But Mine.&quot; From the non-Zeppelin material, the Crowes and Page soar on covers of the B.B. King shuffle &quot;Woke Up This Morning&quot; and the Chicago blues stomp of Jimmy Rogers' &quot;Sloppy Drunk.&quot;\n\nRecorded live at the Greek Theatre, Los Angeles, California.\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:153a1cadcf3bf7073a4a9d799789fb0016c68b2b","amp;dn":"Jimmy+Page+%26+The+Black+Crowes+-+Live+At+The+Greek+%28EAC.FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"153a1cadcf3bf7073a4a9d799789fb0016c68b2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,58,28,173,207,59,247,7,58,74,157,121,151,137,251,0,22,198,139,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
