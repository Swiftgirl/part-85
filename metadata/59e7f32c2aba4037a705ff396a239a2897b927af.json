It will be a godsend to those who already know better. GENESIS ARCHIVE contains live cuts, demos and other previously-unreleased material by the band from their creative heyday. With vocalist Peter Gabriel at the helm, the band managed the difficult task of adding both sociopolitical relevance and real rock and roll excitement to '70s progressive rock.\nOn liveversions of classic cuts like &quot;I Know What I Like&quot; and &quot;Firth of Fifth&quot;, Gabriel and company offer more energy than on the recorded versions without sacrificing any of the band's vaunted instrumental delicacy. The late-'60s demos of such tunes as &quot;In The Wilderness&quot; and &quot;Build Me A Mountain&quot; offer an illuminating glimpse of the group before they began exploiting the more electronic end of music technology. The centrepiece of this set, though, is a full live recording of the band's celebrated conceptual piece &quot;The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway&quot;, which proved to be the swansong of Gabriel-era (i.e. prime) Genesis.
