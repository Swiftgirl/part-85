An aggressive and unrelenting phone campaign to radio stations for their breakaway single &quot;Kryptonite&quot; ... Full Descriptionsnowballed into a showcase at New York's legendary CBGB's and a deal with Universal Records. The Escatawpa, Missouri quartet offers a sound that is grounded in '90s alternative rock but doesn't ignore the contributions of hard-rock music's foundations from the '60s and '70s. \n\n&quot;Loser&quot; finds 3 Doors Down using Alice In Chains-influenced minor-key vocal harmonies and acoustic-then-electric dynamics. In &quot;Duck and Run,&quot; vocalist/lyricist Brad Arnold urges fans to remain positive despite life's trials. The delicate balance of human relations is explored in &quot;Not Enough.&quot; In &quot;Be Like That,&quot; Arnold sings of a daydreamer's envy, sounding like a heavier Matchbox 20. Though the band began as a power trio, with Arnold on drums and vocals, 3 Doors Down added a second guitarist and a drummer to fatten its sound for THE BETTER LIFE. \n\nRecorded at Ardent Studios, Memphis, Tennessee. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thetracker.org:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thetracker.org:80/announce&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sumotracker.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sumotracker.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb6823b9de6427bc887eb9332f76948a746000a3","amp;dn":"3+Doors+Down+-+The+Better+Life+%28EAC+FLAC%29+ResourceRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb6823b9de6427bc887eb9332f76948a746000a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,104,35,185,222,100,39,188,136,126,185,51,47,118,148,138,116,96,0,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
