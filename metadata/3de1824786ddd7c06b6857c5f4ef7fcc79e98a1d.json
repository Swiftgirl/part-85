Their movie the link goes to their page on Fanedit.org giving their story. All I'm gonna add is this is a great Zombie Movie. I've never actually seen the show version of it, but I'm going to after seeing this.\n\nSeed and enjoy. Also, seriously, you guys that troll around anything called a fanedit and bitch about how they're just bullshit and the editors should have just made their own movie. Shut the fuck up. Seriously. If my torrent is shitty, by all means flame it, but if you don't like the content then don't bother commenting.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3de1824786ddd7c06b6857c5f4ef7fcc79e98a1d","amp;dn":"Dead+Set+Serious+%282008%29+Fanedit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3de1824786ddd7c06b6857c5f4ef7fcc79e98a1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,225,130,71,134,221,215,192,107,104,87,197,244,239,127,204,121,233,138,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
