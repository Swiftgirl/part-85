Inside, you'll find a &quot;wpIntellicast.dll&quot; file along with a &quot;Languages&quot; folder. Within the &quot;Languages&quot; folder, you will find a &quot;langEnglish.txt&quot; file. Both, the &quot;Languages&quot; folder and the &quot;wpIntellicast.dll&quot; file should already be installed on your device.\n\nHowever, in case they're not, read below.\n\nUsing Active Sync, browse to the installation directory on your device. It should be similar to &quot;StorageProgram FilesTouch Weather&quot;. If you do not see the &quot;wpIntellicast.dll&quot; file, copy/paste it here now. If you see it already, disregard.\n\nIn that same directory, you'll find the &quot;Languages&quot; folder. Go inside of it and check to see if the &quot;langEnglish.txt&quot; file is there. If not, copy/paste it there now. If you do see it, disregard.\n\nApp should be fully registered already.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n-Shifter-\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ce41df5fa8f75d4638fb603f84b84aa2df52d20","amp;dn":"Touch+Weather+v1.0.0.4174b+English","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ce41df5fa8f75d4638fb603f84b84aa2df52d20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,228,29,245,250,143,117,212,99,143,182,3,248,75,132,170,45,245,45,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
