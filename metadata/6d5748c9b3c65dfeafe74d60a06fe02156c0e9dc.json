This Bani called Japji Sahib, appears at the very beginning of the Guru Granth Sahib from Page 1 to Page 8 . It, the most important Bani or 'set of verses', is recited by all Sikhs every morning. The word ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“JapÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ means to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“reciteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢/ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“chantÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢/'to stay focused onto'. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“JiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is a word that is used to show respect as is the word ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“SahibÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. \n\nThis Bani was composed by the founder of the faith, Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji who was the first of ten human Gurus of this faith. The Ten Gurus of Sikhism were responsible for the creation of this faith which took place over period 1469 to 1708 - a period of about 239 years. At the point when the last of these Gurus departed this Earth, the Guruship was passed to Holy Book, the SGGS. SGGS is treated as a living Guru and the respect shown for Thy Commandments is unique. This Bani encompasses the spirit &amp; theme of whole of the Sri Guru Granth Sahib. \n\nThe collections of hymns of Sikh daily prayer are often compiled separately in a small book form called Gutkas or &quot;Nitnem&quot; (meaning daily prayer) Gutkas. All Nitnem Gutkas start with Japji Sahib and contain other Banis (hymns) as well. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d5748c9b3c65dfeafe74d60a06fe02156c0e9dc","amp;dn":"Japji+Sahib","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d5748c9b3c65dfeafe74d60a06fe02156c0e9dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,87,72,201,179,198,93,254,175,231,77,96,160,111,224,33,86,192,233,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
