New vehicles include: a Mini, a Panoz roadster, a Ford pickup and a Greyhound bus. Gameplay is essentially the same, being arcade oriented with simplified handling and physics, and pure action modes.\n\nThe roads, hazards and visual style of London and San Francisco are incorporated. A Crash Course Career mode allows players to take the role of a stunt actor or a taxi driver. The races are short and simple, but the player should expect tight turns and tighter time limits.\n\n\n\nExtract Archive With Winrar Or 7zip etc.........\n\nThen Mount Image To Virtual Drive\n\nInstall The Game And Play\n\nKEEP IMAGE MOUNTED TO PLAY GAME\n\nPATCH AND EDITING TOOLS INCLUDED\n\n\nENJOY AND PLEASE SEED\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bbc40b2182f13a9880d60491f26fcc5fbfe4b89","amp;dn":"Midtown.Madness.2.PC.Game%28djDEVASTATE%C3%A2%E2%80%9E%C2%A2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bbc40b2182f13a9880d60491f26fcc5fbfe4b89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,188,64,178,24,47,19,169,136,13,96,73,31,38,252,197,251,254,75,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
