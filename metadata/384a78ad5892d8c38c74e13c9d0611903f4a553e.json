Nonetheless, it's a very well-made movie.\n\nGeoffrey Rush is fascinating in the lead role as &quot;David Helfgott.&quot; However, I would give equal kudos to Noah Taylor, who played Helfgott as a teenager, and to Armin Mueller-Stahl, who was Helfgott's father. They were just as impressive as Rush.\n\nThis is a supposedly true-life story of child prodigy piano player from Australia. As you can imagine, the music in here is excellent. Even better is the cinematography. Wow, this looks and sounds fantastic on DVD.\n\nAlthough not always pleasant to watch, the story is riveting; hard to put down once you've started watching. The ending turned me off a bit with the overt plug for astrology, but is a happy one for all parties and at least leaves the viewer feeling satisfied.\n\nIn all, a very intense, beautifully-photographed biography","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:384a78ad5892d8c38c74e13c9d0611903f4a553e","amp;dn":"Shine+-+Brilhante","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"384a78ad5892d8c38c74e13c9d0611903f4a553e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,74,120,173,88,146,216,195,140,116,225,60,157,6,17,144,63,74,85,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
