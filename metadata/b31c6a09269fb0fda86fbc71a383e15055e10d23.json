It's a diverse terrain of erupting          \n    volcanoes, forest-clad mountains, spectacular valleys,    \n    rolling grasslands, huge lakes and mighty rivers, and      \n    is home to crocodiles, hippos, lions, elephants, flocks   \n    of flamingos and a diversity of indigenous peoples.      \n                                                              \n    Using state-of-the-art high definition filming             \n    techniques, this series investigates the geological       \n    forces which shaped East Africa's Great Rift, and which  \n    make it one of the world's most wildlife-rich             \n    landscapes.                                                \n                                                              \n    The Great Rift Valley channels a huge diversity of       \n    waterways - rivers, lakes, waterfalls, caustic springs    \n    and coral seas - spanning from Egypt to Mozambique.        \n    Some lake and ocean deeps harbour previously unseen       \n    life-forms, while caustic waters challenge life to the   \n    extreme.
