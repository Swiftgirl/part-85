For though the world has stood up and stopped the bastard, the bitch that bore him is in heat again.&quot; Peckinpah's intense and belligerently non-commercial work, (based on the book by Willi Heinrich), is a World War II tale told from the German perspective, following a platoon of German soldiers in the Russia of 1943, when the German Wehrmacht forces had been decimated and the Germans were retreating along the Russian front. James Coburn is Steiner, a German corporal and recipient of the Iron Cross who feels that he owes his loyalty to his family and fellow soldiers and not to Hitler  and the German war machine. But when a new commander, Captain Stransky (Maximillian Schell), takes over the platoon, Steiner and Stransky come into immediate conflict. Stransky is a career soldier, the complete opposite of Steiner, and a man who pledges himself heart and soul to Hitler  and the war. But he envies Steiner for having been awarded an Iron Cross and deeply desires one himself. The problem is Stransky is a complete coward and recognizes that the only way he can be awarded an Iron Cross would be to get the bitter Steiner on his side. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                    \n                    PLEASE,DON'T FORGET TO SEED AT LEAST 1,5","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f34bee4c49cc7a4f7b075d3645b3f67b0f320f25","amp;dn":"Cross.Of.Iron.CUSTOM.PAL.DVDR.GLADiAT0R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f34bee4c49cc7a4f7b075d3645b3f67b0f320f25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,75,238,76,73,204,122,79,123,7,93,54,69,179,246,123,15,50,15,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
