Vista gave the Start menu a welcome redesign; in Windows 7, the Taskbar and the System Tray get a thorough makeover.\nLuckily for Microsoft, Windows 7 is more than just spin. It's stable, smooth, and highly polished, introducing new graphical features, a new taskbar that can compete handily with the Mac OS X dock, and device management and security enhancements that make it both easier to use and safer. Importantly, it won't require the hardware upgrades that Vista demanded, partially because the hardware has caught up, and partially because Microsoft has gone to great lengths to make Windows 7 accessible to as many people as possible.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cec8317f78f8338f51fde82fd7eeae9dd3e1e2d0","amp;dn":"Windows+7+Ultimate-32+bit_en","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cec8317f78f8338f51fde82fd7eeae9dd3e1e2d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,200,49,127,120,248,51,143,81,253,232,47,215,238,174,157,211,225,226,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
