HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s known for producing abstract hip-hop, breakbeat and downtempo music that combines acoustic (sampled) as much as electronic (synthetic) sounds.\n\nWillbe has composed music themes for Demoscene.tv, Scene.org awards, and many demos. HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also the maker of the Demovibes mixed compilations that gather the finest demoscene music soundtracks.\n\nOut from the demoscene, Willbe has released ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlues is something to meÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ at Neferiu records, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMonsieur BÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ at Backseat records (as a 7ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ limited vinyl edition), and remixes for Laurent Garnier (F-Com) and Lootpack (GrooveAttack).\n\n(from) LastFM\n\nlinks:\nhttp://www.williamlamy.com/\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\nMP3 STEREO VBR (self riped) ~224 kbps\n\n01.11.2008 - Livedown\n01.11.2009 - Demoscene Worxx\n02.03.2009 - Melodic Instrumental Hip-Hop EP\n11.10.2007 - Watching demos can kill you\n13.07.2009 - Time Machine (10th anniversary remaster)\n26.12.2009 - Waxxelerated (10th anniversary remaster)\n\nAnd\n\nRemixes by Willbe\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\nP.S.
