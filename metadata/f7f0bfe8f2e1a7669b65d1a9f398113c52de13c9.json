The film's screenplay was written by FranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ois Girard (who also directed) and Don McKellar.\nThe film does not present a single narrative, rather a series of thirty-two short films. These include documentaries (five interviews with people who knew him), re-creations of scenes from Gould's life, and various odd items (such as &quot;Gould Meets McLaren&quot;, in which animated spheres reminiscent of those in Norman McLaren's animations move to Gould's music). The segments range in length from six minutes to less than one minute. The form is inspired by Johann Sebastian Bach's Goldberg Variations, which was Gould's first acclaimed recording.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7f0bfe8f2e1a7669b65d1a9f398113c52de13c9","amp;dn":"Thirty+Two+Short+Films+about+Glenn+Gould","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7f0bfe8f2e1a7669b65d1a9f398113c52de13c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,240,191,232,242,225,167,102,155,101,209,169,243,152,17,60,82,222,19,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
