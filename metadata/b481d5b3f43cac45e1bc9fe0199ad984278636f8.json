The game features familiar Rock Band modes such as &quot;Quickplay,&quot; &quot;Solo,&quot; &quot;Duel,&quot; and &quot;Band Tour,&quot; with a progression of increasingly difficult tunes that are unlocked through skilled play. As in other Rock Band collections (and earlier rhythm-action games from developer Harmonix), play involves pressing buttons in time with the music, as directed by colored symbols that scroll outward and down the screen. Hitting the correct controller buttons at the correct times allows players to perform their instrument's part in the song. Focusing on crossover popularity, the Country Track Pack features 21 well-known songs from the borderlands where rock &amp; roll meets country-western, including &quot;Good Time&quot; from Alan Jackson, Brooks &amp; Dunn's &quot;Hillbilly Deluxe,&quot; &quot;Sin Wagon&quot; by the Dixie Chicks, Kenny Rogers' &quot;The Gambler,&quot; and Lucinda Williams' &quot;Can't Let Go.&quot;\n\n..................\n\nEnjoy and please help seed\n\nCivic/Scootin","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b481d5b3f43cac45e1bc9fe0199ad984278636f8","amp;dn":"Rock+Band+Country+Track+Pack+%28NTSC-USA.ESR-Pre.Patched%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b481d5b3f43cac45e1bc9fe0199ad984278636f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,129,213,179,244,60,172,69,225,188,159,224,25,154,217,132,39,134,54,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
