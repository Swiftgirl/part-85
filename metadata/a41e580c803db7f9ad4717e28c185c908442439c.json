However, we have absolutely no clue how    ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‹â€ \n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‹â€   we are supposed to make money on this since we give away our songs for    ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‹â€ \n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‹â€   free, but someone has got to take the first fumbling steps to find out    ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‹â€ \n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‹â€   how it can be done and we believe that Rednex is perfect for any          ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‹â€ \n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‹â€   ground-breaking try-outs.
