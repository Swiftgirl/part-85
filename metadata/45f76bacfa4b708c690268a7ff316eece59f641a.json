A bas-relief in the temple where she is entombed \nin Luxor shows them bringing back extraordinary treasures. \nBut did this expedition really happen? And if it did, where exactly is the land of Punt?\n\nDrawing upon recent finds, the archaeologist Cheryl Ward sets out to recreate the voyage, in a full-size replica of one of these ancient ships, sailing it in the wake  of Hatshepsut's fleet, in search of the mythical land of Punt. \nA human adventure as well as a scientific challenge, the expedition proves that, contrary to popular belief, the ancient Egyptians had the necessary tools,science and techniques to sail the seas.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45f76bacfa4b708c690268a7ff316eece59f641a","amp;dn":"BBC4+The+pharaoh+who+conquered+the+Sea+%287+jan+2010%29+%5BTVRip%28AVI%29%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45f76bacfa4b708c690268a7ff316eece59f641a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,247,107,172,250,75,112,140,105,2,104,167,255,49,110,236,229,159,100,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
